Left more uncertain is what, exactly, the schedule will look like. With a variety of possible structures generating buzz in recent days, it\u2019s conceivable that the postseason format will be as abnormal as the season preceding it.\n\nThe day-to-day rhythm of the playoffs will change depending on the format\u2014but will the eventual structure impact teams\u2019 chances of advancing and winning a championship? To investigate, we can use a prediction model\u2014based mostly on regular-season point differential, a strong predictor of future success and a strong historical basis for playoff predictions\u2014with tweaks for the various possibilities, and compare the results.\n\nToday we\u2019ll look at four potential scenarios: a standard playoff format with 16 teams and conferences intact; a conferenceless format with 16 teams seeded straight through, regardless of East\/West affiliation; an expanded format with 20 teams and play-in games for the bottom seeds in the bracket; and a World Cup\u2013style format, as outlined by The Ringer\u2019s Kevin O\u2019Connor, with 20 teams and a group stage round.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with the simplest and most familiar-looking bracket. If the NBA used the standings as they stood when the season came to a halt on March 11, some teams like the Pelicans might complain about being deprived the opportunity to chase the no. 8 seed, and others like the Rockets might complain about unlucky seeding. But the regular season was mostly complete by the time the COVID-19 pandemic forced a league shutdown. There isn\u2019t a perfect solution; going with familiarity might be the best option.\n\nThis system would function the same as any standard playoff bracket, just without home-court advantage. Yet that advantage doesn\u2019t typically have a major impact on playoff odds; it really only matters in a potential Game 7, which doesn\u2019t occur all that often, and even then isn\u2019t ironclad. The higher-seeded team usually wins a playoff series because it\u2019s better, not because it has an extra game at home.\n\nSo while teams lose a few points of playoff odds without home court\u2014Milwaukee\u2019s title odds, for instance, drop 4 percentage points on neutral courts, according to this model\u2014the differences aren\u2019t staggering. If the NBA doesn\u2019t make any other changes to the playoff format, either via shorter series or the kinds of structural changes discussed below, the bracket will look fairly routine. Here\u2019s the baseline expectation:\n\nThree surprising takeaways emerge on first blush. The first is the Bucks\u2019 predominance, which is echoed in other projection systems from Basketball-Reference, ESPN\u2019s BPI, and ESPN writer Kevin Pelton. There\u2019s much more to say about Milwaukee\u2019s robust fortunes, but let this chart suffice for now. In addition to these Bucks, 11 teams in NBA history have posted the point differential of a 65-win season or better; eight of those 11 teams won a title, a ninth lost to another team on the list, and a 10th famously blew a 3-1 lead in the Finals.\n\nThe second takeaway is the model\u2019s pessimism toward the Clippers. Anyone reading this piece\u2014and writing this piece\u2014probably thinks L.A. has better than a 6 percent chance to lift the trophy; in its case in particular, with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George missing many games, the regular-season numbers could underestimate the team\u2019s potential.\n\nIf we adjust the Clippers\u2019 baseline expectation by considering only the 32 games that Leonard and George played together, and not the team\u2019s entire body of work, their Finals odds jump from 19 to 32 percent, and their title odds double from 6 to 13 percent. Those odds still aren\u2019t too high for two reasons, though: First, even with both stars playing, the Clippers posted a much worse point differential than the Bucks (plus-8.4 points per game, versus plus-11.3 for Milwaukee). And second, the Clippers would still be forced into an unpleasant first-round series. \n\nThat takes us to takeaway number three: Dallas is an excellent team and, based on its underlying numbers, a sneaky pick to make a deep playoff run if the bracket allows for it. \n\nSix teams this season have a net rating better than plus-3.5 points per 100 possessions. Five are top-three seeds in their respective conferences; the last team is Dallas, all the way down in seventh place in the West. Thanks in large part to the most efficient offense in recorded NBA history, the Mavericks boast a point differential far better than that of every other second-tier contender. Perhaps that\u2019s why Mark Cuban is so eager to ensure his team remains in the full playoff field and not forced into a play-in tournament\u2014he knows his team has a real shot to advance a few rounds.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nA second possible playoff format is much like the first, with 16 teams frozen in the standings as they were on March 11, but with conferences eliminated because travel concerns no longer apply. This scenario seems somewhat unlikely because of opposition from Eastern teams\u2014but the math suggests they don\u2019t actually have anything to worry about, at least for this season.\n\nThe 16-team setup would feature these matchups:\n\nAnd this chart shows how each team\u2019s odds would change for each round, as compared to the baseline scenario:\n\nThe greatest beneficiary would be, surprisingly, Toronto. The difference isn\u2019t particularly noticeable for the first round (neither Brooklyn, without Kyrie Irving or Kevin Durant, nor Memphis should give the Raptors trouble), but it manifests in the second. Toronto vs. Boston, a likely second-round matchup in the standard format, would be an effective toss-up (52-48 percent in the Raptors\u2019 favor), while Toronto would have a theoretically easier time defeating the Nuggets, Jazz, Rockets, or Pacers in the second round of a conferenceless setup. The Raptors would also get to avoid the Bucks\u2014the league\u2019s best team on paper\u2014until the Finals, as opposed to facing them a round earlier in a world with conferences.\n\nBeyond Toronto, Denver would benefit from an easier first-round opponent (Indiana, instead of Houston), while Utah would suffer from the reverse (Houston, instead of Oklahoma City). The Clippers\u2019 odds would actually fall because of a brutal gauntlet of opponents: They\u2019d still have to face the pesky Mavericks in the first round, then potentially the Celtics in the second, then the Bucks, and then the Lakers. That\u2019s four of the five best teams by point differential in the league (not counting themselves).\n\nFor the most part, though, the odds aren\u2019t all that different from team to team. Differences of just 1 or 2 percentage points aren\u2019t worth any attention, and especially after the first round, larger gaps between the two formats don\u2019t appear very often. Of course, the Bucks would be anxious to avoid a potential matchup with the fourth-seeded Clippers in the semifinal round, and as we mentioned above, the pure odds are underselling L.A.\u2019s potential. Even then, however, given the Bucks\u2019 statistical superiority and the Clippers\u2019 difficult route through the first two rounds, the Bucks wouldn\u2019t see their odds drop by a prohibitive amount using the adjusted Clippers numbers\u2014only falling from 57 to 54 percent, with L.A.\u2019s title odds rising from 4 to 10 percent and other teams\u2019 shifting imperceptibly.\n\nAnother playoff structure with support among general managers expands the field with a play-in tournament, although the logistical details of such a tournament aren\u2019t yet clear. To project this sort of scenario, we adopted a miniature version of the boss\u2019s Entertaining-as-Hell idea and pitted the no. 9 seed Wizards and no. 10 seed Hornets in a single-game matchup in the East, with the winner taking on the no. 8 seed Magic in a single game to determine which team would face the Bucks. Out West, no. 9 Portland matched against no. 10 New Orleans, with the winner taking on no. 8 Memphis to determine which team advanced to play the top-seeded Lakers. (Sacramento and New Orleans have the same record, so the NBA would need to figure out a mechanism to break this tie; for the sake of illustration, we used the Pelicans, who hold the tiebreaker in the current standings.)\n\nWhile this scenario removes some possibility of the Magic and Grizzlies making the \u201creal\u201d first round, it barely budges any odds beyond the play-in round itself. The no. 1 seeds are already so dominant that a first-round upset is unlikely, and it\u2019s not as if the Wizards or Hornets have a better chance to defeat Milwaukee than the Magic do. (In fact, the Hornets are so poor, with the fourth-worst Pythagorean record in the NBA, that a Bucks vs. Hornets playoff series would register as the most lopsided playoff matchup in the entire 65-year shot clock era, even without the Bucks\u2019 typical home-court advantage.)\n\nMilwaukee\u2019s baseline odds to make the second round are 97.7 percent. Add in the play-in tournament and those odds scarcely move, to 98.3 percent. The Lakers\u2019 odds evince an even smaller change, from 92.3 percent to 92.4 percent. And because the no. 8 seeds were so unlikely to advance very far anyway, and because the difference in team quality between, say, the Grizzlies and Trail Blazers\/Pelicans is already meager, the ripple effects beyond the first round are negligible.\n\nIn other words: A play-in tournament would affect early entertainment only\u2014not the actual challenge for any team outside the current no. 8 seeds, nor any future portion of the bracket.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nNow we\u2019re in for a much greater change, with the World Cup\u2013style group stage proposal discussed at The Ringer this week. Essentially, this structure would replace the first round of the playoffs with a larger group stage, with 20 teams (the 16 current playoff teams, plus the next four in the standings: Portland, New Orleans, Sacramento, and San Antonio) drawn into four groups of five teams apiece. The teams would be placed into tiers, with one team drawn from each tier to form a group, and then two of the five teams in each group advancing to the second round.\n\nThe tiers would shape in descending order of record, meaning:\n\nThe implications of this scenario are less clear than the others, in part because it\u2019s wider afield from normal and because the placement of teams into groups means more randomness versus a strictly seeded bracket. So to make sense of the situation, we ran a bunch of simulations, generating possible groups, predicting the chances that each team would advance, and averaging all the results.\n\nAlso, because the World Cup scenario is really a hybrid playoff format, with regular best-of-seven series after the initial group stage cuts the field to eight final teams, we projected just that first round to see how teams\u2019 odds of reaching the final eight would change.\n\nFirst, the Clippers would be thrilled\u2014their odds would rocket upward because they\u2019d no longer be guaranteed to face the Mavericks. Denver\u2019s odds would also remain stable because they wouldn\u2019t necessarily face Houston. But every other team in the top 10 would see its second-round chances fall, with the drops ranging from 4 to 14 percentage points. The favorites would still be favored, of course, but not by as much; it seems that a group stage really would increase the chances for chaos in the playoff bracket.\n\nThat randomness might make for a more entertaining spectacle; of all the major American sports, basketball sticks closest to the expected script in its postseason. Fans like upsets.\n\nAnd in this scenario, also-rans in a typical season would have a real chance to make noise in the playoffs. The four new teams added to the bracket\u2014the Trail Blazers, Pelicans, Kings, and Spurs\u2014all have low advancement odds individually, but taken together, there would be a roughly 30 percent chance that one of those four advanced. In that same vein, odds for Orlando and Memphis rise, even if they\u2019re still low, because those teams would be able to play some easier opponents than the Bucks and Lakers, respectively.\n\nYet fans also like watching stars compete in the late playoff rounds, and it stretches the imagination to think that the NBA would artificially reduce the chances that LeBron James advances. As Kevin explained, one way to advantage the top teams in a World Cup scenario would be to give the teams from better tiers the tiebreaker in the event of a tied record\u2014so if the Lakers and Grizzlies each finished 5-3 to tie for second place in their group, the Lakers would advance by virtue of their superior regular-season record. (The above odds reflect this tiebreak instruction.) That advantage matters; if every team were equally talented, the teams from better tiers would receive a decent boost because of the tiebreaker alone.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a great deal more uncertainty in this scenario, even with that advantage. Beyond suppressing odds in the higher tiers, the World Cup setup would also add more variability to teams\u2019 possible outcomes. Different teams\u2019 chances could fluctuate wildly depending on the luck of the draw. \n\nFor instance, in one simulation, the Lakers nabbed a group with the Celtics (the best Tier 2 team), the Rockets (the best Tier 3 team), the Mavericks (the best Tier 4 team), and the Pelicans (the best Tier 5 team). In that scenario, the Lakers would still be favored to advance\u2014but only 71 percent of the time. Conversely, if the Lakers were drawn with the worst teams in every tier, their advancement odds would rise to 87 percent. That\u2019s a wide range based entirely on luck, and one the NBA might not want to pursue with so many eyeballs on the line.\n\nKevin laid out a number of attractive reasons for a World Cup scenario: more games, more variety, and more immediate stakes. Yet there would be some cost, as well\u2014in this case, a real chance that the league\u2019s best and most popular teams won\u2019t advance to the later knockout rounds. Those teams are understandably resistant to the idea. The entire planning process for an unprecedented postseason involves tradeoffs; here would be just one more on the pile. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","similarity":0.9999999404},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/4\/12\/18307008\/nba-playoff-momentum","id":18071049,"title":"No Mo: Why End-of-Season \u201cMomentum\u201d Won\u2019t Help (or Hurt) in the Playoffs - The Ringer","description":"The Houston Rockets are the hottest team in the NBA coming into the 2019 postseason.

The Nuggets do not. The Jazz do. The 76ers do not. The Thunder do, or maybe they don\u2019t. The same dilemma afflicts the Celtics. The Magic might have the most momentum of any team in the league.\n\nDespite copious research showing that momentum in sports is a myth, at least on a large scale, fans and analysts can\u2019t help but discuss the concept this time of year. It\u2019s still tempting to preview a playoff series by noting that, say, the Rockets defense looks mighty formidable lately, and the Nuggets have had trouble scoring, and the Sixers haven\u2019t jelled as expected since February\u2019s trade deadline.\n\nHere, for reference, is a chart that shows how hot and cold the 16 playoff teams are by comparing their winning percentage in their last 20 games with their overall season winning percentage. (That context is included because a 14-6 record from the Magic is more impressive than the same record from the Warriors.)\n\nAnd now forget everything that chart taught, because none of it matters. Trying to predict the future from end-of-season records is the equivalent of sports haruspicy. Based on NBA playoff history, there\u2019s no reason to expect any of this purported momentum, positive or negative, to carry over to the postseason.\n\nLast month, NBC Sports\u2019 Tom Haberstroh showed that how the top-two seeds in each conference perform down the stretch doesn\u2019t matter for the playoffs. And earlier this week, analyst Dean Oliver looked at regular-season results since 2005 on a month-by-month level and found that records from March and April are no more predictive\u2014and if anything, less predictive\u2014than records from earlier months.\n\nWe can expand that kind of analysis further by increasing the sample size and looking at historical playoff results in a few ways. Let\u2019s start simple. First, the larger the regular-season sample, the more predictive it is in forecasting which team will win a given postseason series. The following numbers come from looking at playoff results since the field expanded to 16 teams in 1984. (The lockout-shortened 1999 and 2012 seasons were cut from this analysis.)\n\nThat\u2019s a good starting point, and it refutes the possibility that late-season record is a better indicator than overall record. But few people would assume that\u2019s the case\u2014nobody would take an 8-seed over a 1-seed just because of a disparate final stretch of the regular season. These numbers are also skewed because the team with a better overall record is probably the team with the better 10- and 20-game records, too. What about when the two don\u2019t match?\n\nThe results don\u2019t suggest any real evidence for momentum there, either. Overall, teams with a worse regular-season record sprung the upset in 22 percent of series. When the lower-seeded team ended the regular season hotter, the upset rate barely budged. Lower-seeded teams with a better record over the last 20 games completed just 24 percent of upset opportunities; with a better record over the last 10 games, they completed just 26 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to find any individual examples of teams that converted late-season momentum into a lengthy playoff stay. Of the 20 teams that most overperformed their overall record over their last 20 games of the regular season\u2014in other words, the 20 hottest teams relative to their established level\u2014not one reached even the conference finals. Yet of the 20 teams that most underperformed down the stretch\u2014the 20 coldest teams\u2014eight reached the conference finals, and five went on to the Finals.\n\nCare for some specific recent examples? Here\u2019s one from last season and one from five years before that.\n\nPolar-opposite specifics can be found among the cold teams:\n\nSo when forecasting upcoming series, history says overwhelmingly to focus not on a team\u2019s recent form, but rather on its overall body of work. Injuries matter, of course, so Indiana\u2019s poor late-season performance without star guard Victor Oladipo shouldn\u2019t be discarded. But in general, trying to draw conclusions about the future from a limited slice of the very recent past is a fool\u2019s errand.\n\nIn analyzing overall team playoff results since 1984, the R-squared value of regular-season winning percentage is 0.45. In less nerdy terms, that means regular-season winning percentage alone\u2014so not factoring in roster strength, or injuries, or opponents, or home-court advantage\u2014explains 45 percent of a team\u2019s playoff success. That\u2019s a meaningful indicator; it\u2019s almost half!\n\nThe smaller slices of the season fare far worse in their predictive power. The final 10 games of the regular season explain only 6 percent of a team\u2019s playoff success, which might as well be nothing at all. (This table shows the R-squared for all playoff games won; the results are essentially identical when looking at playoff series won instead. They\u2019re also essentially identical when looking at point differential instead of winning percentage.)\n\nWhy is this relationship so weak? There are plenty of possible reasons\u2014from an uptick in missed games down the stretch for star players on top teams (like with Giannis Antetokounmpo this year) to inconsistent scheduling in the final weeks (are the Jazz really scorching, or did they just enjoy an end-of-season cakewalk?) to matchups being far and away the most important factor in any given playoff series.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean to never pick a hot team, or pick against a cold team, in the playoffs. Want to pick San Antonio to upset Denver, or Brooklyn to upset Philadelphia, or Houston to advance past Golden State to the Finals? Go ahead. But focus more on the matchups and teams\u2019 specific strengths and weaknesses. Misconceptions about momentum won\u2019t help.","similarity":0.9999389648},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/8\/26\/20830217\/team-usa-2019-fiba-world-cup","id":20594258,"title":"Embrace the Unknown With Team USA - The Ringer","description":"The U.S. roster may be one of its worst in recent history, but the unpredictability that brings should make the team\u2019s 2019 FIBA World Cup run its most fascinating international competition since the Redeem Team","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/7gI_WRKGDcpc6c7JtGP9FuKe26k=\/0x215:3000x1786\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19103542\/team_usa_getty_ringer.jpg","tags":"Front Page,NBA,Sports","groups":["NBA","Sports"],"author":"Dan Devine","date":"2019-08-26T06:30:00-04:00","content":"Team USA won all eight games it played at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The squad claimed its third straight Olympic gold medal by drilling Serbia\u2014which had given the U.S. quite a scare in the preliminary round\u2014by 30 points in the tournament final. Kevin Durant scored 30 points in the gold-medal game, tied for the third most in a single game in Team USA history; two more performances worthy of the top five were also authored by \u201916 members. Overall, the U.S. outscored its opponents by an average of 22.5 points per game, continuing America\u2019s dominance as the world\u2019s premiere basketball superpower. And yet, basketball fans tend to remember that team\u2014when we remember it at all, that is\u2014as something of a shoulder-shrug.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nSee, the previous edition, which won gold at the 2014 FIBA World Cup, won its nine matchups by an average of 33 points per game. That just outpaced the 32.1 points per game by which the 2012 team smoked the competition at the London Olympics. The 2010 FIBA World Championship team featured no established superstars, relying almost entirely on early-20s talents who hadn\u2019t yet taken The Leap; their average margin of victory was still 24.6. That was down from 27.9 for the 2008 Redeem Team, the star-studded collective intended to restore the established order of things after the fat-and-happy U.S. lost an unthinkable seven games in a three-tournament run from 2002 through 2006 that included two bronze medals and a (gulp) sixth-place finish.\n\nWinning gold isn\u2019t enough. Staying undefeated isn\u2019t enough. Hell, an average margin of victory of 22.5 points per game isn\u2019t enough. Every U.S. side lives in the shadow of the Dream Team, with mind-bending dominance expected and anything short of that deemed a disappointment. After a staggering spate of withdrawals, this year\u2019s Team USA will take the court in China this weekend at the FIBA World Cup with one All-NBA performer, two All-Stars, and a slew of young players without experience in international competition. They will also arrive with more questions than answers, especially after Friday\u2019s 98-94 defeat at the hands of Australia in a World Cup tune-up, marking the first loss by a U.S. team featuring NBA players, exhibition play or otherwise, since September 2006.\n\nAnd you know what? Thank God for that. Inevitability gets old, and Superman can\u2019t be brave. Let\u2019s try embracing uncertainty and vulnerability for a change. It\u2019s not our standard operating procedure with Team USA, but it might be just what the doctor, and this roster, ordered.\n\nLast week, my Ringer colleague Zach Kram offered a statistical evaluation of whether this is the worst Team USA roster in modern history. It may well turn out to be! That doesn\u2019t really matter, though, because I\u2019ve got good news: Kemba Walker and Donovan Mitchell don\u2019t have to guard Michael Jordan and Chris Paul. Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Khris Middleton don\u2019t have to deal with Kevin Durant, LeBron James, and Scottie Pippen. Myles Turner doesn\u2019t have to keep Charles Barkley and Shaquille O\u2019Neal off the glass. This roster doesn\u2019t have to beat the ghosts of Teams USA past; it has to be able to beat the other 31 present-day teams competing in China. And despite Friday\u2019s loss, the U.S. remains a strong favorite to do just that. \n\nThis year\u2019s model lacks the megawatt names of its predecessors, but no other country in the field can boast legitimate NBA players at every spot on the roster. When other nations have to reach all the way into the back of the cupboard to fill out the end of their benches, they might find a half-eaten box of stale cereal or an expired can of beans. The U.S. pulls out the NBA\u2019s leading 3-point shooter and a 25-year-old four months removed from putting up 36-5-5 in a playoff game. The sheer depth and breadth of available talent\u2014especially on the wing, and especially when it comes to combining size and athleticism on the defensive end\u2014ensures a higher floor than any other entrant can match, even if the team\u2019s potential heights remain a question mark.\n\nAnd it\u2019s absolutely fair to wonder what this team\u2019s peak will look like, especially after watching Patty Mills torch the U.S. for 13 fourth-quarter points while Walker and Mitchell clanged contested jumpers. The U.S. is still favored to take home gold yet again, but the fact remains that this roster\u2019s most established player is Walker\u2014a very good point guard, but not a top-10 NBA player by virtually any measure. We don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to see, especially when the U.S. winds up locking horns with opponents led by MVP-caliber performers, like Serbia\u2019s Nikola Jokic or the actual reigning MVP, Greece\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo. I\u2019m really interested to see how the U.S. is going to guard Giannis, now that neither Thaddeus Young nor P.J. Tucker will be on the final roster. \n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nThe defensive problems could extend to the backcourt, too. While there\u2019s no Hardens or Stephs in the rest of the field, Mills\u2019s 30-point outing on Friday raises concerns about how much damage other talented guards could do against Team USA. France (Evan Fournier and Nando De Colo), Spain (Ricky Rubio and Sergio Llull), and Argentina (Nicol\u00e1s Laprov\u00edttola and Facundo Campazzo) all feature a pair of quality creators. Players like Serbia\u2019s Bogdan Bogdanovic, Germany\u2019s Dennis Schr\u00f6der, Lithuania\u2019s Mantas Kalnietis, and Canada\u2019s Kevin Pangos are all capable of keeping the U.S.\u2019s guards on their toes, too.\n\nAll the withdrawals suggested it, and Friday\u2019s loss to Australia laid it bare: For the first time since Manu Ginobili left the basketball-watching world slack-jawed in 2004, there could be one game (or more!) in this tournament in which the U.S. doesn\u2019t have the best player on the floor. And for the first time since an experienced Greece sliced and diced the U.S. in \u201906, we\u2019ll get to find out how Team USA responds to a loss. All that introduces uncertainty into proceedings typically marked by the utter absence of it. It also raises the fundamental question of whether, in a single-elimination situation like the knockout-round stage of the World Cup, a team with the right single superstar can overwhelm an opponent with superior depth. The chance to find an answer to that question while watching USA Basketball is something new and, it seems to me, the most compelling reason to watch. Well, that and wanting to find out what kind of international incident Marcus Smart\u2019s defense might ignite.\n\nMaybe this all winds up being much ado about nothing, and a seemingly underwhelming Team USA roasts the rest of the world just the same as always, in a replay of the 2010 tournament that helped propel the likes of Durant, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Derrick Rose, and Kevin Love to stardom. Or maybe this is, as our Rodger Sherman recently theorized, the competition where overall roster degradation passes the breaking point, resulting in a reset-button defeat that will start the whole USA Basketball cycle all over again. Whichever way things break, it feels like there\u2019s more possibility for chaos in this competition than there\u2019s been in ages, and we get to choose how we feel about that. Chase those ghosts and lament how appallingly indestructible this team isn\u2019t if you\u2019d like. If only for the novelty, though, it might be more fun to find out what it feels like not to be Superman for once.","similarity":0.9998121262},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2020\/5\/11\/21254188\/title-expectations-michael-jordan-lebron-james","id":21018229,"title":"How Many Titles Should Michael Jordan Have Won? - The Ringer","description":"We introduce two new metrics to determine which NBA stars exceeded their title expectations.","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/GAsvOvVaSG9mPBgaKNXQCr0iLoA=\/0x0:1200x628\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19957322\/playoff_odds_kram_getty_ringer.jpg","tags":"Front Page,NBA,Sports","groups":["NBA","Sports"],"author":"Zach Kram","date":"2020-05-11T06:20:00-04:00","content":"A ring is a ring, and every NBA championship should be treasured\u2014but not all title paths are created equal. The 1996-97 Bulls needed to beat the 44-win Bullets, 56-win Hawks, 61-win Heat, and 64-win Jazz in a row; 40 years earlier, the Celtics and rookie Bill Russell received a bye to the conference finals, then beat the 38-34 Syracuse Nationals and 34-38 St. Louis Hawks to win the franchise\u2019s first championship.\n\nOr: Everyone reading this piece knows that Michael Jordan won six titles to LeBron James\u2019s three\u2014but accounting for team quality and home-court advantage, LeBron\u2019s team was favored in only two of his nine Finals appearances; a third was a toss-up, and the other six saw him as the clear underdog.\n\nJordan, meanwhile, made three fewer Finals, but he always had roughly even odds or better when he made the championship round. (The odds dipped just below 50 percent against the 1992-93 Suns because Phoenix would have hosted a potential Game 7.)\n\nAs the Last Dance documentary series approaches its conclusion and the Jordan vs. LeBron debate continues\u2014as if it ever took a break\u2014it\u2019s worth considering not just each player\u2019s absolute success, but also his achievements relative to expectations. How many titles should Jordan have won? How many for LeBron? And what about all the other stars whose trophy cases fascinate fans?\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nLet\u2019s answer those queries by determining the championship expectations for every team and player since the introduction of the shot clock in 1954. And then let\u2019s see what we can learn about players who have most significantly overachieved in the playoffs. (If you don\u2019t care about the math behind the method, feel free to skip the next couple paragraphs.)\n\nTo get our results, we\u2019ll weigh a variety of factors: the aforementioned team quality, opponent quality, and home-court advantage, plus others like series length and byes. Using teams\u2019 Pythagorean records\u2014which are based on their point differentials, rather than straight wins and losses, and are thus a better predictor of future success\u2014and the Log5 method pioneered by Bill James, we determined the chance that every team would win every playoff series against its opponents (or the potential opponents it would have played, for a team that lost before the Finals). From there, it was a simple next step to figure out every team\u2019s odds of navigating its playoff path to raise the trophy. Here\u2019s how that chain looks in practice, using two of Jordan\u2019s teams as examples.\n\nThose final odds become the team\u2019s \u201cexpected titles\u201d count for that season, and each player on the roster receives the same count. In the above example, all the players on the 1989-80 Bulls earn 0.02 expected titles, and all the players on the 1990-91 Bulls earn 0.53 expected titles. Add up all those counts for every season of every player\u2019s career in the shot clock era, compare it to his actual title count to fit a \u201ctitles above expectation\u201d framework, and we get a bird\u2019s-eye view of his playoff over- or underperformance.\n\nSome important caveats apply. For instance, the method doesn\u2019t account for injuries that may have skewed a team\u2019s regular-season record, or the possibility of momentum (if it even exists in the NBA playoffs). Still, this simple procedure proved remarkably accurate in estimating teams\u2019 chances of winning past playoff series. For instance, the model calculates 85 past playoff series in which the favorite had 90 percent odds or better. We\u2019d expect about five upsets out of those 85, given their series odds\u2014and indeed, we\u2019ve observed exactly that number. The method seems to work, so let\u2019s look at what it says.\n\nHow do Jordan and James compare by the titles above expectation metric? Here\u2019s Jordan\u2019s annual chart, which shows that he won six titles versus just 2.8 expected.\n\nThe wonder of Jordan\u2019s playoff success is that he never squandered a realistic opportunity. Six times his team had a 10 percent title chance or better, and all six times he took advantage. James\u2019s record, meanwhile, features at least one high-profile miss, as the 2008-09 Cavaliers had a coin-flip chance of winning the championship but lost to Orlando in the conference finals. Several other teams of his had feasible attempts that fell short. Here\u2019s LeBron\u2019s version of the yearly expectations chart.\n\nCompared to Jordan, James\u2019s legacy carries a whiff of playoff failure, thanks to his 3-6 record in the Finals. But it\u2019s important to recognize that James has still won more titles than expected\u2014in particular, his 2016 triumph was a tremendous surprise, as the Warriors\u2019 dominance from 2015-18 meant that James had little chance of a title in any of those seasons. This chart also speaks to the dichotomy of James\u2019s playoff record: On the one hand, he\u2019s made three more Finals than Jordan did despite a similar expectation (4.0 for Jordan, 3.8 for LeBron); on the other hand, he\u2019s overachieved by \u201conly\u201d 1.2 titles, compared to Jordan\u2019s 3.2 more than expected. James might have won more titles than his team and opponent quality suggests he should have\u2014and the cities of Miami and Cleveland are surely pleased with that level of performance\u2014but when it comes to the GOAT argument, even adjusting for all sorts of context, Jordan still bests his closest rival in terms of playoff success.\n\nWe can expand beyond Jordan and James, too. Let\u2019s look at every player who\u2019s participated in at least one postseason in the shot clock era and sort them all by titles above expectation. You might expect Jordan to rise to the top of the leaderboard\u2014but he doesn\u2019t quite make it. Instead, the no. 1 player is Robert Horry.\n\nBig Shot Bob isn\u2019t even a Hall of Famer, but he won seven titles\u2014two with the Rockets, three with the Lakers, and two with the Spurs\u2014versus an expectation of just 2.1. His Rockets were statistical underdogs in both Finals in which they appeared, and none of his other title teams were overwhelming favorites.\n\nYet for as phenomenally as Horry played on the big stage\u2014he went 7-0 in the Finals!\u2014it\u2019s probably more instructive to home in on the stars who played a greater role in leading their teams to victory. Limiting the pool to players who made at least one All-NBA team in their career, here\u2019s the list of 13 players who have exceeded their expected championship tally by at least 1.5 rings. (The full list of players is available here; the full list restricted to All-NBA players is here.)\n\nUnsurprisingly, a number of 1960s-era Celtics make the list. The playoff path was much easier for the best teams then versus now\u2014for most of the decade, the top seed in each conference received a bye to the conference finals, removing opportunities for early upsets\u2014and Boston usually had the best team, but 11 titles in 13 years, as Russell managed, is still quite the accomplishment. Even the Celtics weren\u2019t championship guarantees every season; for Russell\u2019s last two rings, they had an 8 percent chance and a 14 percent chance, respectively.\n\nBeyond the Celtics, the top player isn\u2019t Jordan either; Kobe Bryant edges out his mentor because his title teams were never as strongly favored as Jordan\u2019s. For instance, the 2000-01 run, in which the Lakers set a record (at the time) with a 15-1 playoff mark, is even more astonishing in retrospect. Despite nearly full regular seasons from Bryant and Shaquille O\u2019Neal, those Lakers had the point differential of a 51-31 team, and their playoff opponents were all superior: Portland (53-29 Pythagorean record), Sacramento (57-25), San Antonio (63-19), and Philadelphia (54-28).\n\nMaybe the 2000-01 Lakers simply underachieved in the regular season. But that one title was part of a trend: Bryant\u2019s teams regularly advanced farther in the playoffs than expected. None of his titles were faits accompli\u2014judging only by the quality of playoff opponents, his Lakers teams faced some of the toughest slates any champion has ever navigated.\n\nTwo general conclusions arise from this exercise, aside from the specifics of individual performances. The first is that it\u2019s really difficult to win a title as a non-elite team. The model calculates a larger difference between 70-win and 60-win teams than between 60-win and 50-win teams, even though they\u2019re both separated by 10 wins. Basically, it\u2019s extraordinarily rare for less-than-elite teams to advance far in the playoffs. For instance, the Roy Hibbert\u2013era Pacers were a solid NBA team for years; they lost to LeBron\u2019s Heat three postseasons in a row, twice in the Eastern finals. But because the Pacers were never actually the best team in the East, let alone the whole NBA, their total number of expected titles in that stretch was a meager 0.1.\n\nHistorically, this pattern appears in the list of NBA champions and finalists. The 1968-69 Celtics (a no. 4 seed) and 1994-95 Rockets (no. 6) are the only teams seeded lower than third ever to win the title, and only three teams seeded fifth or lower\u2014the sixth-seeded 1994-95 Rockets, sixth-seeded 1980-81 Rockets, and eighth-seeded 1998-99 Knicks\u2014have ever even reached the Finals.\n\nThe second key takeaway, related to the first, is that it\u2019s already sufficiently difficult to win one title; it\u2019s even more of a challenge to win multiple. Relative to expectations, every player who\u2019s collected multiple rings should be lauded for his achievements. It\u2019s almost impossible to build out a trophy case while underachieving.\n\nIn the shot clock era, 69 players have won at least three championships, and all 69 overperformed their expected title count. And out of the 80 players with exactly two titles, 75 overperformed by at least a bit. (The greatest underachiever in that group was Wilt Chamberlain, who won two titles versus 2.8 expected. Danny Ainge is the only two-title underachiever who\u2019s played since the postseason bracket expanded to 16 teams.) Some players overachieved by more than others, of course, but they all achieved something (or multiple somethings) special, from Jordan to LeBron to Horry at the very top of the titles above expectation historical leaderboard.","similarity":0.9995796084},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/10\/16\/20916254\/overseas-teams-nba-preseason","id":20680295,"title":"The Track Record for Overseas Teams in NBA Preseason Is Bad.

They\u2019re probably going to win. Melbourne is a good National Basketball League team; they finished second in the Australian league last season and first in the standings (delightfully called the league\u2019s \u201cladder\u201d) the season before. But Melbourne could win the NBL with an undefeated record every year and still be extreme underdogs against the Kings. \n\nEvery preseason, a number of NBA teams play against non-NBA opponents. Most of these games go unnoticed; they\u2019re mostly a showcase to international audiences. But this pseudo-competitive environment also provides a worthwhile laboratory setting\u2014not to test the readiness of NBA teams for the upcoming season, but to measure the quality of NBA squads outside the league\u2019s competitive vacuum.\n\nThe NBA is a closed, zero-sum environment; every player assessment and team analysis inherently involves comparisons to other NBA teams. When someone concludes, say, that the 2019-20 Wizards roster looks putrid, it\u2019s because of a mental comparison between the Wizards and the established NBA baseline. Throwing international teams into the mix, even in games that don\u2019t strictly count for anything, allows some wider context to seep in. And what do you know? In this scenario, even the 2019-20 Wizards can win a game by 39 points.\n\nThese October scrimmages do not make for perfect experiments. In the preseason, starters play reduced minutes or miss games entirely; the games are sloppier than normal NBA contests as coaches tinker with rotations and playbooks; the international teams are almost certainly more motivated than the NBA players going through the motions of preparing for a new season. But it\u2019s the best experiment we have, and the results are plenty revealing.\n\nWith one meeting to go, NBA squads have utterly dominated these games this fall: 13 NBA squads have combined to win 13 games against international competition, by an average margin of 38.2 points. Houston beat the Shanghai Sharks by 69 points. Philadelphia beat the Guangzhou Lions by 58. Utah beat the Adelaide 36ers by 52. Every other NBA team to play a foreign opponent this preseason has won by double-digits.\n\nBut what about throughout history? We dug deep into the archives to find out. A list on Wikipedia dating back to the late 1970s includes results for 155 games between NBA and international teams over the decades, with NBA teams holding a 138-17 record in those contests. That tally is missing scores from a few games, though, so we\u2019re going to focus on the matchups since the 2007-08 preseason, which is when more thorough box score stats became available on NBA.com\/Stats.\n\nOver the last 13 preseasons (including this one), NBA teams facing non-NBA competition in official preseason games are 98-10\u2014the equivalent of 74 wins over an 82-game schedule. In other words, against non-NBA competition, NBA teams as a whole are as good as the record-setting 1995-96 Bulls and 2015-16 Warriors.\n\nThe box-score statistics are also hilariously lopsided. The average score in these games has been NBA teams, 110; non-NBA teams, 88. That\u2019s an average margin of 22 points. For reference, the worst single-season point differential in an 82-game schedule belongs to the 1992-93 Mavericks, at negative-15 per game.\n\nNon-NBA teams have collected more turnovers than assists. They\u2019ve shot worse than 40 percent from the field. They\u2019ve allowed an effective field goal percentage that would rank sixth all-time for any team in a single season; basically, they\u2019ve turned haphazard NBA rosters who aren\u2019t even trying into the equivalent of the best LeBron James Heat teams.\n\nThe most instructive line from that chart, though, might be free throw percentage. Over 13 preseasons and more than 100 meetings, NBA and non-NBA teams have have shot the same percentage from the charity stripe. Even if they are wildly overmatched when put into live-ball situations against NBA talents, these non-NBA players are still skilled; they\u2019re still professionals. \n\nOne important factor in these results is the location of these games. Outside North America, NBA teams are 15-7 against non-NBA opponents\u2014a fine but not overwhelming record. At home, for comparison, they\u2019re 83-3, with a much better margin of victory to boot. \n\nWhen not granted the gift of home court, good NBA teams have struggled against top-tier international competition. In a 2016 trip through Spain, the Thunder lost to Real Madrid in overtime and beat Barcelona by three. In 2014, the Spurs fell to Alba Berlin on a buzzer-beater. In October 2010, Barcelona beat the defending champion Lakers and favorite son Pau Gasol in Spain. (Kobe Bryant played 25 minutes as he recovered from knee surgery; he shot 2-for-15 from the field, and the Lakers as a team went 0-for-14 on 3-point tries.)\n\nThe three home losers, for those curious: \n\nThere have been other close games in the States\u2014including from Melbourne, which nearly upset the Thunder in 2017, when Paul George (39 minutes), Steven Adams (35), Carmelo Anthony (31), and Russell Westbrook (29) basically played full games, and Oklahoma City still needed a pair of last-second blocks to escape with an 86-85 win.\n\nThey came THIS close   @MelbUnitedHQ fall by a single point to the @okcthunder  Tell your mates, the NBL has arrived #NBLxNBA pic.twitter.com\/lV5KYwOVKo\n\nBut the vast majority of games have been blowouts; over the weekend, even with George and Kawhi Leonard resting, the Clippers coasted to an 18-point win over Melbourne. A comparison of the names in the box score shows why: Melbourne\u2019s best player was Melo Trimble, former University of Maryland star and G Leaguer, who dropped 22 points and six assists.\n\nThe point isn\u2019t that NBA teams sometimes receive a scare from lesser competition. As entertaining as those results\u2014and the \u201cLet\u2019s Remember Some Guys\u201d quality the other teams\u2019 rosters evoke\u2014are, the point is that even in those circumstances, NBA teams still utterly dominate non-NBA competition. NBA teams are the best in the world, by far, and this little experimental setting confirms the fact. Wednesday\u2019s game should just provide another data point to demonstrate the disparity.","similarity":0.9994652867},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/9\/6\/20852607\/fiba-world-cup-serbia-patty-mills","id":20616648,"title":"Everything You Missed at the World Cup While White-Knuckling Through Team USA Games - The Ringer","description":"From Serbia\u2019s emergence as a global power to the joy of FIBA Patty Mills, here are the most interesting things happening in China when the U.S. isn\u2019t teetering on the brink of disaster","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/5QtzI7gNmDxk2Of8QwE8LfRBYrw=\/0x0:3000x1571\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19173054\/devine_world_cup.jpg","tags":"Front Page,NBA,Sports","groups":["NBA","Sports"],"author":"Dan Devine","date":"2019-09-06T09:44:09-04:00","content":"The second round of the 2019 FIBA World Cup gets underway Friday, with the top 16 teams from the original 32-team field moving on to another group stage to determine which eight countries will advance to the single-elimination knockout rounds. If you\u2019re reading this from the U.S. or elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere, though, you might not have caught too much of the tournament so far\u2014well, beyond a depleted Team USA getting through undefeated, but looking awful rickety at times in the process\u2014since the action in China has largely taken place while you\u2019re either sleeping or getting ready for your commute.\n\nOn the off chance that you prioritized REM cycles over watching former Washington Wizards captain Andray Blatche suit up for the Philippines\u2014spoiler: It didn\u2019t go great\u2014 let\u2019s quickly catch up on the state of play after Round 1 by taking a look at the five most interesting (non-U.S.) things that\u2019ve happened so far in the World Cup, starting with the (non-U.S.) team to beat ...\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nBefore the World Cup, Serbian head coach Sasha Djordjevic made it plain that his team was hungry for another crack at Team USA after coming up short in the finals of both the 2014 FIBA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s let them play their basketball and we will play ours,\u201d Djordjevic said during an interview with Serbia\u2019s RTS. \u201cAnd if we meet, may God help them.\u201d\n\nEurohoops.net noted that Djordjevic gave that quote \u201cin a semi-serious tone.\u201d But after watching their first four games, it doesn\u2019t seem like Serbia\u2019s messing around. Like, at all.\n\nAfter winning its first two games in Group D by a total of 105 points, Serbia faced its first real challenge against Italy, the no. 13 team in FIBA\u2019s rankings, who featured veteran NBA scorers Danilo Gallinari and Marco Belinelli, plus several players with EuroLeague experience. When Gallinari ripped off 11 straight points to cut Serbia\u2019s lead to 55-53 in the third quarter, it looked like maybe, on the heels of Team USA\u2019s nail-biter against Turkey and Greece\u2019s falling to Brazil despite employing the NBA\u2019s MVP, there was no dominant side, and close calls would be more the rule than the exception.\n\nBut Serbia promptly shook off Gallinari\u2019s haymaker and regained control, using its significant size advantage to bulldoze the Italians on the glass and earn free throws. (Former Bucks bruiser Miroslav Raduljica shot 13 freebies in just eight minutes.) By the end of the third, Serbia was back up by 13; Italy wouldn\u2019t get closer than eight the rest of the way, as Serbia cruised to a 92-77 win to finish Round 1 undefeated, and largely unbothered. They kept rolling on Friday, opening the second round with a 90-47 pasting of underdog Puerto Rico.\n\nSerbia boasts the tournament\u2019s highest-scoring and most efficient offense, led by the inside-out tandem of big man Nikola Jokic and guard Bogdan Bogdanovic. Jokic has built on his MVP-caliber campaign for the Nuggets with a killer start to the World Cup, going 20-for-24 from the floor through four games. He\u2019s been a load to handle on the boards and the block. He\u2019s also been a dynamic facilitator, delivering 18 assists:\n\nSerbia with the 78-47 lead over Angola after three quartersJokic  Milutinov #FIBAWC pic.twitter.com\/d6IILF8d7P\n\nWhat makes Serbia so dangerous is the combination of Jokic\u2019s presence in the paint, his peerless passing vision, and a roster full of shooters capable of making defenses pay for overloading to stop the star big man. The rest of the team is feasting, going 41-for-90 (45.6 percent) from 3-point range. And nobody\u2019s been hotter than Bogdanovic, the Kings swingman who has thrived as Serbia\u2019s top finisher, averaging 19.3 points in 23.4 minutes per game while shooting 53.2 percent from the field and a scorching 57.1 percent from 3-point range on seven attempts per game:\n\n31 PTS, 5 AST & 5 STL for Bogdan Bogdanovic during Serbia's win over Italy. He's now shooting 15-of-23 from 3 through 3 World Cup games. Italy gave him too much space off the catch. Such a killer at the FIBA level with his ability to score + playmake out of a variety of actions. pic.twitter.com\/TUiZOhA2VZ\n\nPoint guards Stefan Jovic and Vasilije Micic have controlled the action, combining for 46 assists against 16 turnovers. The mammoth frontcourt rotation of Jokic, Raduljica, Boban Marjanovic, and Nikola Milutinov has dominated the front of the basket on both ends of the floor; in fact, Serbia\u2019s front line is so loaded that Jokic, arguably the second-best player in this tournament, has been coming off the bench, allowing the enormous Marjanovic to start the game by pulverizing overmatched opponents to set the tone.\n\nSerbia\u2019s deep, tough, and versatile, with the playmaking talent to spread you out and the physical presence to win a street fight. Sunday brings what should be a damn good test against Marc Gasol and Spain. If Jokic, Bogdanovic, and Co. pass that, they may well enter the knockout stage as the favorite to go all the way, no matter what sort of work Team USA turns in during the second round. \n\nIf you\u2019ve caught only his act in the NBA, you might think of Mills in positive but somewhat diminutive terms\u2014as a \u201cspark plug,\u201d or a \u201cmicrowave,\u201d or a \u201csolid role player.\u201d But when Mills trades the silver and black of the San Antonio Spurs for the green and gold of Australia, he goes from sixth man to superstar.\n\nPatrick.

He finished second at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, behind only Bojan Bogdanovic of Croatia. And he\u2019s the highest scorer at this World Cup among players whose countries made it out of the first group stage. With Joe Ingles and Matthew Dellavadova handling primary playmaking duties in Australia\u2019s multiple-ball-handler system, Mills has free rein to whip around the court with reckless abandon. He slaloms around screens, sprints into catches before exploding into the paint, and rises and fires without compunction. Defenders know he\u2019s coming, but they still can\u2019t seem to stay in front of him, keep him from getting to his spots, or prevent him from finding just enough daylight to get his shot off. It\u2019s wild.\n\nThe structure of the Aussie offense calls for Mills to be a gunner, and he obliges, putting relentless pressure on opposing defenses all over the court. And once he gets going, he can put up points in bunches \u2026\n\n12pts in the 3rd Quarter for @Patty_Mills!   #AUSSEN #AustraliaGotGame #FIBAWC @BasketballAus \u270d https:\/\/t.co\/cCvWa1x1FE pic.twitter.com\/eCdBCr5au9\n\n\u2026 as he did when he took over in the fourth quarter of Australia\u2019s second exhibition matchup with the U.S., handing the Americans their first loss in any international competition in 13 years:\n\nWhat Mills does in San Antonio is nothing to sneeze at. He\u2019s earned his keep at the NBA level, growing from the 55th pick in the 2009 draft and a towel-waving novelty act into a vital rotation cog in the Spurs\u2019 ever-whirring machine; lest we forget, it was Patty\u2019s 14-point third quarter that helped seal the fate of the last Big Three Heat team in the 2014 NBA Finals. What he gets to be for the Boomers, though, is something special; it\u2019s just so much fun to watch a scorer fully unleashed.\n\nMills relishes that latitude. Australia\u2019s success in recent years has been built on its defense, and the interior toughness of big men like Andrew Bogut and Aron Baynes. But Mills\u2019s flair for offensive fireworks is a big reason why\u2014despite the absence of hoped-for national teamers like Ben Simmons, Dante Exum, Jonah Bolden, and Thon Maker\u2014Australia enters the second round undefeated, with a berth in next summer\u2019s Olympics already sewn up and with a real shot to make a run for a medal over the next week and a half.\n\nManu Ginobili\u2019s watching tennis.

The members of the \u201cgolden generation,\u201d the group that shocked the United States out of its fat-and-happy slumber and turned Argentina into an international basketball power, have all fallen victim to Father Time and hung up their sky-blue-and-white uniforms.\n\nWell, all except one.\n\nWe witnessed HISTORY today as the living LEGEND @LScola4 climbed to 2nd place in the all-time #FIBAWC scoring list! #ArgentinaGotGame\u21aa https:\/\/t.co\/CIYw5M8XTc@cabboficial    pic.twitter.com\/lkgvIJbowE\n\nA little under eight months shy of his 40th birthday, Luis Scola is still in those blue-and-whites, still running up and down the court with dudes who hadn\u2019t yet hit puberty when he first joined the senior national team. And, delightfully, he\u2019s still roasting defenders who must think to themselves, \u201cSurely this older gentleman with the salt-and-pepper hair poses no threat to me and my teammates,\u201d only to find themselves getting drop-stepped around and on the business end of a soft scoop layup off the window.\n\nScola\u2019s no longer the top dog on the Argentine side; these days, the squad\u2019s led by star Real Madrid point guard Facundo Campazzo (whom U.S. fans might best remember as the guy who punched Carmelo Anthony in the balls that time). But Scola can still produce, averaging a team-high 17 points and nine rebounds per game in the first group stage to help Argentina go 3-0 to top Group B. The veteran big man is now the second-leading scorer in FIBA World Cup history, trailing only Brazilian legend Oscar Schmidt.\n\nWhile he\u2019s firmly a below-the-rim player these days\u2014no more emphatic dunks like the one he hammered on the cruller of Richard Jefferson back in 2004\u2014Scola\u2019s proving that the craft of his game can still be plenty effective. How long and how well he\u2019ll hold up amid the physicality of life in the FIBA paint remains to be seen, but for the time being, Scola\u2019s decision to keep lacing up his high-tops after his longtime compatriots have hung theirs up seems like a good one\u2014and one that might help Argentina make some noise come the knockout round.\n\nWe knew coming into the tournament that France would hang its hat on defense; teams with Rudy Gobert in the middle tend to do that. Sure enough, Les Bleus allowed fewer total points in the opening round (194) than any team besides Spain (190), helping them complete a 3-0 run through Group G. France also has a ton of perimeter talent, with longtime national team star Nicolas Batum, Magic wing Evan Fournier, EuroLeague guards Nando de Colo and Andrew Albicy, and former top-10 NBA draft pick Frank Ntilikina all capable of initiating offense, knocking down shots, and handling multiple defensive assignments. Few teams in the field can match their combination of stifling defense, length on the wing, 3-point shooting, and off-the-bounce juice; that\u2019s why our Danny Chau tabbed France as one of the five teams with the best chance of knocking off Team USA in a potential matchup.\n\nWelcome to the bl\u26d4ck party hosted by @FRABasketball!    #FranceGotGame #FIBAWC pic.twitter.com\/yl5guoYIyX\n\nThe problem, though, is that the structure of the tournament hasn\u2019t done France any favors. Waltzing through Group G with a hard-fought win over Germany, followed by annihilations of Jordan and the Dominican Republic (which also advanced), earned France a spot at the top of their second-round group. But they\u2019re paired with the winners of Group H, Australia and Lithuania, and the format dictates that you\u2019ve got to play both of the teams you haven\u2019t already faced. That means France has to deal with Lithuania on Saturday, with interior bullies Jonas Valanciunas and Domantas Sabonis plus quality depth on the wing and in the backcourt, and the Aussies on Monday, with their own tough defense and Mills ready to explode at any time.\n\nFrance looks better than both of those teams on paper, but those are still two tough outs. It\u2019s certainly a more treacherous road than coach Vincent Collet would like to be traveling, knowing that both Australia and Lithuania will get one easier game against the Dominican Republic, and that only two teams will advance to the quarterfinals. Handle this perilous pair of games, and France solidifies its status as a legitimate threat to win the World Cup. But if the French stumble in consecutive appearances against stiff competition, another disappointing result along the lines of their sixth-place finish at the 2016 Olympics and 12th-place performance at EuroBasket 2017 could be in the offing.\n\nWhen I first caught Brazil at this World Cup, I was struck by how much of their roster I remembered from previous international competitions \u2026 and, honestly, how that seemed like it might not be that great a thing!\n\nLeandro Barbosa and Anderson Varej\u00e3o, last seen in the NBA in 2017? Marcelinho Huertas, once considered among the best point guards not in the NBA, but flamed out during a two-year stint with the Lakers and is now 36? Alex Garcia, who turns 40 next year and has been playing pro ball since 1999? This was the backbone of a good Brazilian team back in 2012, when they made it to the quarterfinals of the Olympics before falling to Manu and Argentina. Seven years later, though, was that\u2014plus a sprinkling of young talent with some NBA ties\u2014going to be enough to win in a World Cup tournament?\n\nWell, so far, so good. Barbosa opened the tournament in style, popping for 22 points in 24 minutes to lead the way in an eight-point win over scrappy New Zealand. Then it was Varej\u00e3o\u2019s turn, as he went for 22 with nine rebounds against Greece\u2014a game that stunningly saw him outplay Giannis Antetokounmpo. The Greek Freak struggled at times with the physical defense of Garcia, whom Brazil head coach Aleksandar Petrovic (brother of the late, great Drazen) said \u201ckicked [the MVP\u2019s] ass,\u201d in keeping with Brazil\u2019s game plan.\n\nEven with Garcia\u2019s ass-kicking and Varej\u00e3o\u2019s turning back the clock a decade, Brazil still needed some last-second heroics to eke out a win over Greece. So, naturally, Bruno Caboclo\u2014yeah, the \u201ctwo years away from being two years away\u201d guy, now past that ETA and just trying to catch on in Memphis\u2014stepped up to handle things:\n\nBruno Caboclo clutch steal on the lob to Giannis pic.twitter.com\/OwsrKdxXmY\n\nBRUNO CABOCLO SECURES BRAZIL'S WIN OVER GREECE pic.twitter.com\/GeeKwaQHi4\n\nAfter Huertas (16 points and six assists) and Bulls center Cristiano Fel\u00edcio (14 points on 7-for-7 shooting with eight rebounds) led the way over Nikola Vucevic and Montenegro, Brazil won Group F. When Brazil lines up against the Americans on Monday, it\u2019ll know that Barbosa and Huertas can test the U.S. guards\u2019 ability to stall dribble penetration; that Varej\u00e3o, Fel\u00edcio, and Caboclo can keep Team USA\u2019s bigs busy on the glass; that Garcia, Caboclo, and 20-year-old Didi Louzada can provide length and defensive disruption on the wings; and that Petrovic has the brass to try something unconventional (like putting the 6-foot-4 Garcia on Giannis) if he thinks it might wrongfoot the U.S. enough to narrow the talent gap. That might not be enough to take down the U.S. and make a push for a medal, but there are worse places to start.","similarity":0.9992460608},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/8\/5\/20755033\/team-usa-fiba-world-cup-training-camp","id":20519074,"title":"So \u2026 Who the Hell Is Left on Team USA? - The Ringer","description":"Mass dropouts have left the US thinner than it\u2019s been in two decades.

Or what\u2019s left of it, at least. Since the federation announced its 20-man roster in June, more than a dozen players have declined to suit up for the national and select teams. Gone are stars like Damian Lillard and Anthony Davis; in their place are names like Mason Plumlee and Thaddeus Young. On Saturday, USA Basketball released a statement that contained one of the bleakest lines in sporting history: After Landry Shamet stepped down from the select team, Team USA named Torrey Craig\u2014a 28-year-old third-year player with 593 career points\u2014in his stead. \n\nWhen Lillard left the fold, my colleague Rodger Sherman wrote that \u201cof the 11 Americans who were named to last year\u2019s All-NBA teams, only one, Kemba Walker, has yet to withdraw from the roster for the 2019 FIBA World Cup.\u201d That much remains true\u2014Boston\u2019s new point guard is the most acclaimed Team USA member left. And if U.S. history in the World Cup is any indication, he might not be enough for the the country to bring home some hardware.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nIn 2002, the U.S. fumbled its way to a sixth-place finish on home soil. Not a single player was named to the all-tournament team. Seven players on that roster had previously been named All-Stars, and two more\u2014Ben Wallace and Shawn Marion\u2014would join the club the following season. It was the U.S.\u2019s worst showing at a major competition in its history, and, coupled with a disappointing bronze medal finish at the ensuing Olympics in Greece, kick-started the Redeem Team era that came to a close in 2016 in Rio.\n\nThe group that reported for camp in Las Vegas on Monday has just three All-Stars: Walker, Khris Middleton, and Kyle Lowry, who\u2019s still recovering from offseason thumb surgery. Defections have always been common in the leadup to international competitions; players withdraw because of injury, or because of contract concerns, or because they just need a break after a long season. What\u2019s transpired this summer is different, though. Head coach Gregg Popovich is entering his first major tournament at the helm with more uncertainty surrounding Team USA\u2019s roster than it\u2019s had in nearly two decades. \n\nIn total, 29 players between the national and select team invitees are competing for a spot on Team USA\u2019s 12-man roster. Practices in Las Vegas will run from August 5-8, with an intrasquad exhibition game on August 9, and players will reconvene in Los Angeles for camp from August 13-15 to prepare for a tune-up game against Spain on August 16 before the World Cup begins on August 31. Here is who\u2019s left entering camp:\n\nWho\u2019s left on the roster: Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell, Kyle Lowry, Marcus Smart, De\u2019Aaron Fox\n\nWho declined: Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Bradley Beal, DeMar DeRozan, James Harden, Eric Gordon\n\nDespite the mass defections, Team USA\u2019s guards still constitute the strongest group on the roster. As previously mentioned, Walker is an All-NBA talent, deserving of the max contract he signed with the Celtics in July. Mitchell, while coming off a somewhat underwhelming season wherein his growth was less pronounced than expected, still projects as a perennial All-Star. And Lowry, now with a ring in tow, provides the U.S. with a veteran presence; along with Barnes and Mason Plumlee, he is one of the only three players with experience for Team USA at the senior level.\n\nSmart could fill the same role for the U.S. as he does with the Celtics, and that Andre Iguogala did for years for the national team: playing lockdown defense and deferring on the offensive side to more polished talents. And Fox, who was reportedly promoted to the senior team on Monday, is coming off a breakout year and could use the tournament as a springboard, like Kevin Durant did at the 2010 World Cup. Even if Lowry isn\u2019t healthy enough to play, the select team\u2019s Trae Young would make a more than suitable replacement. Barring any last-minute withdrawals or injuries, guard play should be a strength for the U.S. in China.\n\nWho\u2019s left on the roster: Khris Middleton, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Harrison Barnes, Thaddeus Young, Kyle Kuzma\n\nWho declined: Tobias Harris, Paul Millsap, JJ Redick\n\nMiddleton is the headliner here, coming off a career year as Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s second fiddle (18.3 points per game, 6 rebounds, 4.3 assists) before agreeing to return to Milwaukee for five years, $177.5 million. His versatility on both ends of the floor, and ability to guard three positions with relative ease, makes him Team USA\u2019s X factor. How his teammates step up will determine whether this summer will serve as his coming-out party, or whether he\u2019ll fare like Richard Jefferson did at the 2004 Olympics.\n\nBarnes has previous Team USA experience, winning gold at the 2016 Summer Games. He played the fewest minutes of anyone on the team in Brazil, but that\u2019s still more action than most others on this roster have seen. Tatum, Brown, and Kuzma are all players that could plausibly make an Olympics roster in years to come, but relying on a trio of 20-somethings is less than ideal. Brown and Kuzma should be solid role players, with the former offering a strong defensive presence and the latter providing versatility on the wing. The scorer of the bunch, Tatum, regressed in his sophomore season and shot significantly worse from beyond the arc while jacking up way more shots from the midrange. (I blame Kobe.) Maybe FIBA\u2019s shorter 3-point arc will entice Tatum to take a step back and play to the percentages. Or maybe Team USA will be destined to watch him drive and pull up from 17 feet six times a night.\n\nI have little to offer on Thaddeus Young, other than to say that the numbers suggest he\u2019s one of the five greatest players to ever live. Who am I to argue with statistics?\n\n pic.twitter.com\/OcA7zthjgt\n\nWho\u2019s left on the roster: Mason Plumlee, Bam Adebayo, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, P.J. Tucker\n\nWho declined: Anthony Davis, Kevin Love, Andre Drummond, Julius Randle, Montrezl Harrell\n\nLet\u2019s start here: Plumlee was invited to the camp, and Coach K isn\u2019t even in charge anymore. Krzyzewski invited his former Blue Devil to the 2014 World Cup in Spain just one season after Plumlee entered the league. He averaged two points per game while spelling Anthony Davis and Kenneth Faried in the post. Back then, the choice could have been chalked up to a coach bringing along a touted youngster he trusted to gain experience off the bench. Now, it\u2019s just confounding.\n\nRandle was the most recent big man to withdraw when he announced over the weekend that he wouldn\u2019t be reporting to camp because of a family issue. After Plumlee, that leaves the U.S. with four big men: Pacers block champion Myles Turner, deep threat Brook Lopez, Miami center Bam Adebayo, and shoe god P.J. Tucker. I\u2019m going to be blunt: This is a bad group. I struggle thinking what Marc Gasol will do to any of these five, let alone what Antetokounmpo might unleash on them. \n\nTurner was the highest-scoring member of the bunch last NBA season, logging 13.3 points per game in what most considered an OK year for the big. And while Lopez shined stretching the floor for the Bucks, neither Plumlee nor Adebayo was a consistent starter for his team. \n\nOn the whole, Team USA is weaker than it\u2019s been in years, but it\u2019s still strong enough to win the World Cup. If things click, the slew of summer dropouts will become a footnote in the long arc of American dominance of the sport. If not, well, let\u2019s just hope the 2020 Olympic team can think of a cool moniker.

That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the whole thing, and if Davis gets his wish and is traded from New Orleans soon, the Pelicans\u2019 rampage through Portland last season will remain the apex of his first NBA stop.\n\nIn only one other season with Davis did the Pelicans even finish with a winning record; in no other season did they win a single playoff game. And with Davis currently hurt and New Orleans mired with a 23-29 record, 5.5 games out of the West\u2019s no. 8 spot, neither stat seems likely to change.\n\nImagine learning that uninspiring future directly after the 2012 draft lottery, when the then-Hornets held just the fourth-best odds but nabbed the winning combination to claim Davis. New Orleans landed the best basketball prospect since LeBron James; the 7-59 then-Bobcats (now Hornets; it\u2019s confusing) landed Michael Kidd-Gilchrist as a lackluster consolation prize. Yet since that seemingly fateful night, New Orleans ranks 21st in the NBA with a 44.3 winning percentage. Charlotte ranks 20th at 44.5 percent.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nIt\u2019s hard to fault Davis for his team\u2019s persistent struggles. The Brow has been named to three All-NBA first teams and, since he was drafted, ranks third in PER and in the top 10 in points, rebounds, and blocks per game. Even New Orleans\u2019s playoff failures aren\u2019t cause to blame its star\u2014if Davis had played enough games to qualify, he\u2019d rank second on Basketball-Reference\u2019s career leaderboard in playoff points per game, his 30.5 average slotting behind only Michael Jordan\u2019s 33.4. And that\u2019s with nine of Davis\u2019s 13 playoff games coming against the Warriors in title seasons.\n\nThat all leads to a somber but, given this week\u2019s developments, pressing question: Has Davis been wasted more than any previous superstar in league history? There\u2019s no definitive answer\u2014B-Ref doesn\u2019t calculate a \u201cwasted\u201d score on its player pages\u2014but we can try to tackle the idea through a few different lenses.\n\nFirst, we could look at championships; Davis hasn\u2019t won one in New Orleans, but he\u2019s far from alone in that respect. In NBA history, 69 players have been named to multiple All-NBA first teams with the same franchise. That counts multiple teams for a few players, like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with the Bucks and Lakers, LeBron James with the Cavaliers and Heat, and Moses Malone with the Rockets and 76ers, among others. Those 69 players unsurprisingly experienced tremendous team success on average, but there are only so many titles to go around; only 37 of them won a championship with the team in question. (Gary Payton\u2019s win with the Heat doesn\u2019t count, for instance, because he was a first-teamer for Seattle, not Miami.) Many of the winners required a second\u2014or third, or more, because the Red Auerbach Celtics were stacked\u2014multi-time first-teamer to earn a ring.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that a team doesn\u2019t need at least one superstar to win. Dating back to 1979-80, when Magic Johnson and Larry Bird entered the league, only two champions didn\u2019t depend on a multi-time first-teamer: the 2003-04 Pistons and the 2007-08 Celtics, who qualify only on a technicality because Kevin Garnett made three All-NBA first teams with Minnesota but just one in Boston. Rather, employing such a player is basically a necessary but not sufficient condition to win a title.\n\nSo if not championships, we can try looking at playoff success more broadly. Here, Davis rates low, but not quite at the bottom. Four of the 69 players didn\u2019t win any playoff series with their teams in question: Pete Maravich, who never reached the playoffs with the Jazz; Tiny Archibald, who lost his only series with the Kings; and Tracy McGrady and Dave Bing, who went 0-for-3 in first rounds with the Magic and Pistons, respectively.\n\nFive other players, meanwhile, tie Davis\u2019s one series win in New Orleans. Jason Kidd won a single series in Phoenix; ditto Jerry Lucas in Cincinnati, Spencer Haywood in Seattle, and David Thompson in Denver. The Indianapolis Olympians\u2019 Alex Groza made two All-NBA first teams in two seasons, won a playoff series against a team named the Sheboygan Red Skins, and was banned from the league for life because of his involvement in a point-shaving scandal in college.\n\nBut two additional strikes count against Davis by this method of comparison. First, Davis has spent more seasons in New Orleans than most of those other players spent with their respective teams. Second, at least Kidd and McGrady and Co. were making the playoffs most years; they were just losing when they got there. Davis has made only two playoff trips in six seasons to date. It should turn to two-in-seven soon, as Davis is injured and his team has just a 25 percent chance of reaching the postseason, according to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nSo with those contextual factors in mind, we can look at perhaps the simplest and most expansive measure of team performance: regular-season winning percentage. On average, the 69 players have collected a regular-season winning percentage just north of 60 percent, and only nine of the 69 amassed a losing record. The 10 best, for curious minds, are as follows (Kareem on the Bucks was 11th, and Kareem on the Lakers was 12th):\n\nBut Davis appears near the end of the opposite list: the 10 worst records for teams that sported a multi-time All-NBA first-teamer. Behold the tragedy of squandered potential:\n\nThe Pelicans with Davis rank 66th out of 69 in regular-season winning percentage. That\u2019s not particularly a function of the team collapsing when he doesn\u2019t play, either: The Pelicans would still appear on this bottom-10 chart, with a 46.8 percent win rate, if you counted only games in which he suited up. The players behind Davis, meanwhile, all have reasonable excuses for their stumbles: Maravich played for an expansion team, also incidentally in New Orleans; King\u2019s run with the Knicks included a full season he missed due to injury, thus tanking his overall record in New York; and Archibald played for a franchise in frequent flux, as his team rebranded from the Cincinnati Royals to the Kansas City\u2013Omaha Kings to the Kansas City Kings just in the time he was there.\n\nMalone\u2019s presence on both lists, best and worst, suggests that Davis isn\u2019t doomed to languish forever on sub-contending teams. Perhaps future success will come\u2014just not, it seems, in New Orleans. It\u2019s reductive to conclude that New Orleans wasted Davis entirely; for his fans, wins and playoff moments are just part of a broader experiential package, alongside the sheer thrill of watching a unicorn do magic for the better part of a decade. The Smoothie King Center\u2019s crowds surely enjoyed Davis\u2019s nightly exploits, just as the nascent Jazz fans enjoyed Maravich\u2019s singular flair, and Knicks fans enjoyed King\u2019s outbursts at Madison Square Garden, and Orlando\u2019s and Philadelphia\u2019s fans enjoyed McGrady and Iverson torching defenses at the start of the century.\n\nBut the Pelicans surely possessed much grander designs\u2014on division titles, on postseason triumphs, on new banners for the arena rafters every year\u2014when they won the lottery seven springs ago. Davis has performed exactly as advertised\u2014but the franchise hasn\u2019t kept pace with its star, and wasted his brilliance more than almost any other in league history in the process.\n\n","similarity":0.9985429049},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/8\/29\/20837355\/team-usa-fiba-world-cup","id":20601396,"title":"The Five Teams That Can Beat Team USA at the 2019 FIBA World Cup - The Ringer","description":"The U.S. is more vulnerable than it\u2019s been in years.

So, here\u2019s one: 2,300. That\u2019s the margin by which Team USA had outscored the rest of the world in the 78 major international games and exhibitions the U.S. had won in a row before getting stunned by Australia in a pretournament friendly Friday. The U.S.\u2019s last loss before that was against Greece, in the 2006 World Championship. That this most recent loss came in an exhibition, however, was in a way even rarer. Saturday\u2019s loss at the hands of a firespitting Patty Mills was only the second exhibition defeat for Team USA since 1992; the first came 15 years ago, when it lost 95-78 in Cologne, Germany, to an Italy team that couldn\u2019t miss from behind the arc.   \n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nTeam USA is still the favorite to win World Cup gold, but the playing field is more level than it\u2019s been in more than a decade. At its peak, the U.S. men\u2019s national basketball team experience is akin to an Avengers moviegoing experience: big stars, big explosions, big, mind-deadening fun. It\u2019s nowhere near as broad in drought years like this; we\u2019re still engaging in the cinematic universe, but it requires some patience, creativity, and openmindedness to fully embrace the heroes, myths, and joys\u2014some might just come from the other side of the divide. \n\nThis is a perfect time to root for the underdog, to root for chaos, to discover a nation\u2019s folk favorite. Because, as if foreshadowing the NBA season to come, it seems as though anything could happen in the 2019 FIBA World Cup. There are a number of teams capable of beating Team USA in a game. With apologies to Germany, Nigeria, Canada, and Brazil (and Australia, though they\u2019ve already done it), here are the U.S.\u2019s five biggest potential threats in the tournament.  \n\nTeam USA\u2019s biggest threat in China is their 2016 Olympic gold medal game opponent. A lot has changed in the three years since Serbia last saw Team USA on the court. Nikola Jokic, now one of the very best players on the planet, was among the seven youngest players in the tournament pool at age 21. But even then, the world caught a glimpse of the kind of unique force Jokic brought to the game. In Olympics preliminary group play, Jokic dropped 25 points (on 11-for-15 shooting) against Team USA, looking like the best player on the court in a three-point loss to the Americans. This time around, he\u2019ll set foot in China as the second-best player in the tournament, behind only Greece\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo. And for the first time in his international career, Jokic will serve as the undisputed focal point of his national team. \n\nWith its depth, size, and star power, Serbia has become something of a cofavorite to win the whole damn thing. And that is without one of the most recognizable Serbian stars of several generations, passing wizard Milos Teodosic, who suffered a foot injury earlier this summer in a game against Lithuania. \n\nSerbia\u2019s biggest advantage over the field may lie in its ability to dictate style of play. The team is enormous; half its roster consists of players 6-foot-10 or taller, and both of its point guards are listed at 6-foot-6. All four of its centers have NBA ties: Jokic, of course, is an All-NBA player; Boban Marjanovic has been a per-minute game-breaker in his four NBA seasons (it\u2019s not hard to imagine Boban feasting under FIBA goaltending rules, which maintains that the ball is still live while it\u2019s on the rim); Nikola Milutinov was a 2015 first-round pick by the Spurs and is now a Greek League star; Miroslav Raduljica was that enforcer-looking type who had cups of coffee playing for the Bucks and Wolves. Pairing the preposterously versatile Jokic in a twin towers setting with either a traditional low-post scorer like Milutinov or one of two bruisers like Marjanovic or Raduljica would be enough to do in most of the teams in the tournament, but they also have the ability to space the floor way out with the Kings\u2019 Nemanja Bjelica, an excellent shooter and passer, at the 4, which might just be an international cheat code. \n\nBjelica\u2019s Sacramento teammate Bogdan Bogdanovic should thrive as a playmaker in the international setting with all the attention paid to Jokic, and will be the team\u2019s go-to perimeter scorer as he shares the backcourt with one of Serbia\u2019s two jumbo point guards. Projected starter Stefan Jovic is the veteran caretaker, but the biggest beneficiary from playing around so much NBA talent will be 25-year-old Vasilije Micic, a rising star in the EuroLeague and 2014 second-round pick by the Sixers, who is the far more dynamic shooter and passer.          \n\nThe French national team\u2019s NBA intrigue took a bit of a hit in the 11th hour after Tuesday\u2019s loss to Serbia in their final World Cup preparation game: The Suns\u2019 21-year-old scoring point guard \u00c9lie Okobo and Theo Maledon, a smooth 18-year-old guard who has the look of a 2020 lottery pick, were both dropped from the final roster. The veteran team, however, still boasts a balanced roster with some of the best talent in the tournament. Rudy Gobert is the clear headliner, and the Stifle Tower will offer both offensive and defensive structure to a French roster that will largely be determined by its perimeter play. Nicolas Batum (who is somehow only 30 years old) has certainly seen better days in the NBA, but his two-way versatility across several positions and roles should alleviate some of the pressures now put on young Knick Frank Ntilikina, who projects as the team\u2019s starting point guard. \n\nFrance\u2019s best lineup against Team USA might just be a four-out attack that leverages its massive defensive presence in the paint and perimeter shooting across positions, with Gobert manning the 5, Batum sliding up to the 4, Evan Fournier at the 3, Nando De Colo at the 2, and Ntilikina at the 1. That would put four capable offensive initiators on the floor at once. All five also have NBA experience; De Colo may have played only one season with the Spurs, but he has blossomed into one of the EuroLeague\u2019s best players. Since joining CSKA Moscow in 2014-15, De Colo has shot 45.4 percent from 3. Both Batum and Fournier have been above-average 3-point shooters in their NBA careers; France will need as many release valves from behind the arc as it can get to shock the favorites. \n\nTeam USA and the Greek national team are expected to be the leaders of their respective groups E and F, which means they will meet in the second round of competition, barring a cosmic catastrophe in China. The case for Greece is simple: They have the undisputed best player in the tournament, a guy who was named the most valuable player in the best professional basketball league in the world. There\u2019s just not much most teams will be able to do if Giannis Antetokounmpo simply decides to drop 30 points in a game. The hope is that the rest of the Greek team\u2014one with many familiar names like Ioannis Bourousis, Kostas Papanikolaou, Nick Calathes, and notorious NBA flameout Georgios Papagiannis\u2014can hold up its end of the bargain. \n\nGiannis changes everything in a setting like the World Cup; it fully explains the level of attention given to the Greeks as legitimate medal contenders. But 2019 could wind up as merely a preface. It\u2019s not hard to imagine all four Antetokounbros leading the way in the near future.   \n\nThe average age of the 12-man Spanish national team is just barely on the right side of 30, clinging to a few stubborn tenths. The youngest player is the Nuggets\u2019 Juancho Hernang\u00f3mez, 23, who has been on the senior team since EuroBasket 2017, but has been on national team practice squads since 2015. An infusion of new blood isn\u2019t coming fast enough, but for the last remnants of Spain\u2019s golden generation, it isn\u2019t over until it\u2019s over. To discount what Marc Gasol, Ricky Rubio, Rudy Fernandez, and Sergio Llull\u2014all veterans of the team for more than a decade\u2014can accomplish together is to deny the impact of chemistry in major international competition, which is exactly how USA Basketball was done in from 2002 to 2006. \n\nGasol, now 34, remains the team\u2019s cornerstone, and it will be hard to ever envision a Spanish team not playing in the image of the country\u2019s two best-ever basketball products. The Gasol brothers have all but instilled the synaptic, read-and-react basketball reflexes into the country\u2019s DNA. It\u2019s the through line that will help ease Spain\u2019s eventual transition from the Gasols to the Hernang\u00f3mezes. This will be Spain\u2019s 12th FIBA World Cup appearance, the most of any European nation in the tournament. It\u2019s no longer the front-runner, but after a decade-plus of watching this team rise to the top of the basketball world with an earnest team-as-family ethos, it\u2019s hard to count it out when a good chunk of the core remains intact.   \n\nIt\u2019ll be a good tournament for twin towers. Lithuania will be propping its medal hopes on the backs of Jonas Valanciunas and Domantas Sabonis, two players who joined the senior ranks in their teens, four years apart, and will now serve as centerpieces. Valanciunas is the established star at this level of competition: At 7 feet tall, with a mammoth wingspan, touch around the basket, and range out to the FIBA 3-point line, Valanciunas is the player most teams will base their game plans around. Sabonis is the wild card, a player who, when given the space to operate, has been staggeringly productive at the NBA level as an inside-outside scorer, rebounder, and facilitator. NBA heads would likely prefer the order of operations to invert. We know what Jonas is; there\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know about Sabonis\u2014namely, his ability to take on a much larger load. The Pacers organization has said that Sabonis and frontcourt mate Myles Turner will be spending more time on the court together in the 2019-20 season, but should the two meet in China, we might get some useful fodder for the Which Big Should the Pacers Actually Build Around? debate.   \n\nThere are other familiar faces on the team: Mantas Kalnietis resumes his post as the trusty no-nonsense point guard, and Mindaugas Kuzminskas of #Knickstape fame will play a role in the frontcourt. But one guy to watch for is 27-year-old wing Edgaras Ulanovas, one of the best players in the Lithuanian league. Imagine a gruffer Joe Ingles who is just as good shooting from distance. There will be plenty of opportunities for him to feast when one of Lithuania\u2019s two star bigs passes out of a double.","similarity":0.9985309243},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba-preview\/2019\/10\/18\/20920177\/nba-preseason-2019-20-regular-season","id":20684218,"title":"What the Preseason Can Tell Us About the Regular Season - The Ringer","description":"Wins and losses may not count in preseason, but the exhibition slate can tell us a thing or two (or three) about what\u2019s in store for the 2019-20 season","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/Lx7dT9wv1-hAVE2cvzhNEcO0W04=\/0x86:1200x714\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19297709\/kram_3_things.jpg","tags":"Front Page,NBA,Sports,2020-21 NBA Preview","groups":["2020-21 NBA Preview","NBA","Sports"],"author":"Zach Kram","date":"2019-10-18T06:30:00-04:00","content":"The NBA preseason doesn\u2019t have much predictive power for individual players. Sure, this preseason\u2019s leading scorers are James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Steph Curry, all of whom finished in the top five in that category last season, but it\u2019s hard to glean any meaning from a tiny number of low-stakes games. We don\u2019t expect Ben Simmons to shoot 100 percent on 3-pointers this season.\n\nIndividual teams\u2019 preseason numbers aren\u2019t all that useful for forecasting the coming season, either. Since 2007-08, the first season that comprehensive preseason numbers are available at NBA.com\/Stats, the correlation between preseason and regular-season winning percentage is just 0.30, on a scale in which zero means no relationship and one a perfect match.\n\nOn a leaguewide scale, however, the signal is much stronger because of the larger sample. At that scale, statistical trends act the same way they do in the regular season, which means this preseason contains some clues about the season to come. Recent iterations of baseball\u2019s spring training have presaged the ongoing rise of strikeouts and home runs; much in the same way, the NBA preseason tells us that the sport\u2019s recent style of play\u2014more points, more 3s, and more pace\u2014should continue in 2019-20. (All stats in this piece refer to only those collected by the 30 NBA teams; international teams, the focus of a column earlier this week, are excluded.)\n\nScoring isn\u2019t up that much this preseason compared to last\u2014110.9 points per game now versus 110.6 points per game then. But we should expect even more points this regular season, given historical patterns.\n\nNBA teams averaged 111.2 points per game last regular season, the highest number since 1970-71. We should have seen it coming: Scoring jumped by nearly seven points per team game last preseason, and, for as long as we have data, regular-season scoring has always tracked the preseason dips and surges. The correlation between the two numbers is extremely high (0.96).\n\nScoring increases every regular season, as players get back in rhythm and starters play more minutes; on average, regular-season scoring has jumped by 2.6 points per game from the preseason since 2007-08. If that trend continues, the leaguewide scoring average would rise to 113.5 points per game this season\u2014a number that no single team reached between 1991-92 and 2015-16.\n\nUnlike with points, the 2019-20 preseason 3-point totals have grown substantially compared with last preseason. An astounding 40 percent of all field goal attempts this preseason have come from beyond the arc. For context, only eight teams in regular-season history have ever reached that number\u2014and that\u2019s the average this preseason. Six teams are above 45 percent, which only the Rockets (in 2016-17, 2017-18, and 2018-19) have ever reached over the course of a full season.\n\nWe should thus expect many more 3-pointers this season, above and beyond the record total from 2018-19. The correlation between preseason and regular-season 3-point attempt rate (the proportion of shots that are 3s) is 0.98, meaning a near-perfect match. In almost every season, the two data points map onto each other perfectly.\n\nAs the blue line denoting the preseason 3PAr keeps rising, so too should the red line denoting regular-season rate. Compared with the 2018-19 regular season, 23 teams have increased their 3PAr this preseason, and 11 of those teams have increased the rate by at least 5 percentage points. Even in small samples, these numbers are meaningful: The correlation between preseason and regular-season 3PAr on a team level is still strong, at 0.85.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nSo expect many more 3s this season from teams like the Wizards (14 percentage point boost from the 2018-19 regular season), Cavaliers (12 points), and Clippers, Bulls, and Timberwolves (10 points each). And don\u2019t expect the midrange-happy Spurs to pivot to a modern offense; San Antonio ranked 30th in 3PAr last season and has seen its number decrease more than any other team\u2019s this preseason.\n\nIn addition to a more efficient distribution of shot attempts, teams are scoring more in part because of an increase in pace, which last season reached its fastest leaguewide mark since 1988-89. And they are still zooming around the court this preseason\u2014the league average of 106.8 possessions per 48 minutes is the highest on record. That preseason rise matters, as the correlation between preseason and regular-season pace is a robust 0.93.\n\nLike points, and unlike 3-pointers, this average represents just a small increase over last preseason rather than another massive surge. And as the graph shows, pace always declines somewhat between preseason and regular season\u2014the average decline since 2007-08 is 3.8 possessions per 48 minutes. This is true of the beginning of the regular season, too, when teams play faster than they do the rest of the season. Even a typical decrease in possessions once the games start to count, though, would yield the league\u2019s fastest pace in more than three decades; at the very least, play should remain frenetic this season. \n\nOther hallmarks of this era of basketball can also be seen in the leaguewide preseason numbers, and thus expected to continue into the regular season: Free throw attempts and offensive rebounding are down, while effective shooting percentage and Zion Williamson stock are up. Even as the competitive landscape has shifted from a dynasty surrounded by challengers to a more democratized slate of potential front-runners, the system and style in which those teams play doesn\u2019t appear to have changed. The NBA\u2019s 3-point boom is far from over, and every accompanying statistical trend looks alive and well heading into this season.","similarity":0.9982101321},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/9\/13\/20864054\/team-usa-superteams-nba","id":20628095,"title":"Team USA Can Learn Something From the NBA\u2019s Superteam Era - The Ringer","description":"Instead of loading up on as many stars as possible for the 2020 Olympics, USA Basketball should copy the game plan of some of the NBA\u2019s top contenders","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/2aX6GDcEZV_yuMeYcBk4Vl9calA=\/0x215:3000x1786\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19195956\/FutureUSATeamBuilding_Getty_Ringer.jpg","tags":"Front Page,NBA,Sports","groups":["NBA","Sports"],"author":"Dan Devine","date":"2019-09-13T08:40:29-04:00","content":"After 13 years of international dominance, the U.S. men\u2019s national basketball team is now on a losing streak. One day after a 10-point loss to France knocked it out of medal consideration at the 2019 FIBA World Cup, Team USA suffered a second straight defeat, this time at the hands of a Serbian squad whose coach had, tongue-in-cheek or not, called this particular shot before the teams ever got to China. A dispirited and depleted U.S. unit stumbled out of the gate, a step slow to contest and engage as Serbia raced out to a 32-7 first-quarter lead that it would not relinquish.\n\nThe U.S. now heads into a Saturday meeting with Poland that will determine whether it finishes in seventh or eighth place. Either way, it\u2019ll be the second-worst finish to a competition in USA Basketball history. That\u2019s a cold cup of coffee for a national program, the kind of thing that makes everybody involved take a long, hard look in that deep, dark truthful mirror.\n\nRight?\n\nThis should be a really short article, right? pic.twitter.com\/Y4fRbnachK\n\nA lot of people may have responded to Team USA\u2019s losses with the same sort of arched eyebrow and yawn implied by the great Robin Lopez here. The answer to how the U.S. gets back on top doesn\u2019t seem all that complicated\u2014just get the best American talent to turn out for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. But there\u2019s a danger in letting \u201cget better players\u201d be the only lesson from this stumble.\n\nAs the business of basketball continues to boom around the world, and as international talent gets better and better, future U.S. teams\u2014the ones beyond 2020, which almost certainly won\u2019t still have LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, and James Harden in the pool\u2014won\u2019t always be able to rely on having the best player on the court. When those days come\u2014as they did against France on Wednesday and Serbia on Thursday\u2014Team USA will need players who fit together better than this year\u2019s model. The whole process has to be more intentional than just, \u201cWho\u2019s still willing to say yes?\u201d In a sense, the challenge and the project share similarities with the rise of the superteam era in the NBA last decade.\n\nThe Celtics became an instant champion by importing two future Hall of Famers to add to the one already in the building. But Boston was an instant monster specifically because its pieces fit so perfectly together: Kevin Garnett commanded the defense and served as the offensive nexus in the frontcourt; Paul Pierce was the primary wing creator and late-game go-to scorer; Ray Allen was the secondary perimeter option, persistent catch-and-shoot threat, and constant floor-spacer. The role players fit, too: Kendrick Perkins set brick-wall (often moving) screens and cleaned the glass, Rajon Rondo initiated the offense and spread the ball around, and everybody else skated their respective lanes.\n\nThe story was the same in other constellation cities. The Big Three Heat, the Big Three Cavs, the Strength-in-Numbers Warriors all figured out the championship formula not just by stacking stars, but by finding the right complementary fits around them. Now, though, we\u2019ve reached a new state of play in the NBA, one in which Big Threes and Big Fours have given way to dynamic duos. That\u2019s thanks in part to the ever-quickening pace of player movement, which has made it difficult to hold on to a star for more than a couple of years at a time. But you might also chalk it up to a shift in front-office thinking that sees greater value in surrounding two superstars with a handful of competent role players than in selling out for three stars and scraping to fill out the rest of the rotation while avoiding luxury tax payments.\n\nUSA Basketball\u2019s brass doesn\u2019t have those sorts of financial concerns; without salary caps to consider, managing director Jerry Colangelo and Co. just have to get the guys to commit. In the post\u2013Redeem Team era, that\u2019s allowed Team USA to just do what every NBA GM would love to do\u2014hoard as many stars as possible with relatively little worry about fit or function. In the beginning, that was no problem: Multiple megawatt stars made multiyear commitments to show up not only for major international competitions, but also for annual minicamps and meetings and such. But after a decade that saw the U.S. firmly reassert itself as the sport\u2019s dominant global power, and with many players from the recent gold-medal squads aging out of the program or dealing with injuries, USA Basketball needs new blood. As we saw this summer, getting the transfusion is proving tricky.\n\n\u201cGoing forward for USA Basketball, we\u2019re going to need the cooperation of teams, agents, and then there has to be communication with players one-on-one to solidify those commitments,\u201d Colangelo told Tim Reynolds of the Associated Press on Thursday. \u201cI am going to be anxious to see how many players reach out early to indicate that they wish and want and desire to play.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible that a bunch will, whether because they want to restore the program\u2019s pride after the losses, or because they\u2019re now lining up for one tournament instead of two. The World Cup being moved from its standard every-four-years schedule (which would\u2019ve had it held in 2018) to this summer meant players committing to it would have to sign up to go from a full NBA season to a major international competition, then right into NBA training camps (which start in three weeks), then (hopefully) into a long playoff run, and then right into preparation for the Summer Games. USA Basketball has grown accustomed to building World Cup squads without the top players from the Olympic teams, but such little downtime in a two-year span is a big ask, even for the non-megastar types who typically populate the in-between rosters\u2014especially with \u201cload management\u201d now a watchword around the league.\n\nWhatever led to the dropouts, the U.S. still had more talent top to bottom than any other nation in the field\u2014no other team could boast 12 NBA players\u2014but pounding that point elides another very important one: FIBA basketball is, y\u2019know, not NBA basketball. Case in point: Giannis Antetokounmpo is the NBA\u2019s reigning Most Valuable Player, and is on the short list of the very best basketball players in the world. Greece still failed to advance to the knockout round because the Greek roster lacked enough shooting to unleash him, and because FIBA\u2019s different rule set, court size, and style of play help mitigate some of what makes Antetokounmpo damn near unstoppable with the Bucks.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nKemba Walker, in a vacuum, is a better basketball player than any of the French guards who carved up the U.S. on Wednesday. But in a structure that prioritizes side-to-side movement and the ability to create for others in the drive-and-kick game, Evan Fournier and Nando de Colo can look like superior options for stretches. Australia beat the U.S. in exhibition play largely because Patty Mills went nuts in the fourth quarter; Mills can go nuts for Australia, in a completely different way than he can for the Spurs, because the Boomers have a bunch of other table-setters, shooters, and screeners to set him free. Turkey, a team nobody pegged to threaten the mighty Americans, came within a free-throw-clanging apocalypse of beating them, because they had the right kinds of players and playing style to give the U.S. problems. As much as the U.S.\u2019s benighted World Cup run laid bare the importance of the U.S. bringing top talent to international competition, it also underscored just how much context, continuity, and fit matter in these tournaments.\n\nFor France, Australia, and Turkey\u2014the teams that pushed the U.S., sometimes past its breaking point\u2014the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. There\u2019s real talent on all of those rosters, but it\u2019s the harmonic convergence of the individual pieces that created something Team USA couldn\u2019t quite match.\n\nThe U.S. needs great guard play, but not just guys who can break down a defender one-on-one and get to the rim. One star point guard and a bunch of solid combo guards\u2014few of whom even have much NBA experience, let alone international experience\u2014doesn\u2019t really cut it anymore; you need multiple bona fide facilitators capable of creating clean looks for others. One wonders how the U.S. offense might have looked had Kyle Lowry, who withdrew to recover from surgery on his left thumb, was able to suit up and calm things down, or if De\u2019Aaron Fox hadn\u2019t pulled out just before the team left for Australia for reasons that remain a bit foggy.\n\nThe U.S. also needs shooters who can actually shoot. Non\u2013Joe Harris\/Kemba players have shot a combined 29.4 percent from the shorter 3-point line at the World Cup, contributing to an American attack that ranks a paltry 18th in the 32-team field in half-court offensive efficiency, according to Synergy Sports Technology numbers cited by ESPN\u2019s Kirk Goldsberry. After watching Brook Lopez and Mason Plumlee provide precious little in the FIBA fortnight, the U.S. badly needs bigs who can do more than just be big\u2014centers and power forwards who can make plays with the ball, whether facing the basket or with their backs to it.\n\nTeam USA can certainly find those players. Some could come in the form of superstar veterans who have declined recent invitations, like James Harden, Anthony Davis, and Damian Lillard. (A playmaking big like Draymond Green or Blake Griffin sure would\u2019ve been awful nice in China.) Some, as my Ringer teammate Jonathan Tjarks suggested Thursday, could come from young rising stars like Trae Young, Devin Booker, Zion Williamson, and Jaren Jackson Jr. There are shooters, defenders, and playmakers galore in the U.S. ranks, ones whose games can dovetail and overlap to create the sort of scorching offenses we\u2019ve seen in the past but that belonged to countries like France and Serbia this year. But the process of putting them together has to be much more intentional than just \u201cgrab the best name left.\u201d\n\nIt won\u2019t take much to put USA Basketball back on the top of the mountain next summer. To keep it there, though, the U.S. is going to need a a better plan, and a smarter approach to building a roster than ever before.","similarity":0.9982013702},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/video\/2019\/10\/22\/20927000\/nba-palooza-can-deaaron-fox-become-an-all-star-sacramento-kings","id":20691041,"title":"\u2018NBA Palooza\u2019: Can Sacramento Kings\u2019 De\u2019Aaron Fox Become an All-Star? - The Ringer","description":"In the latest edition of \u2018The Leap,\u2019 J.

Devin Booker and new point guard Ricky Rubio tallied double-doubles, and so did center Deandre Ayton, with 18 points and 11 boards, and Phoenix ended Wednesday with the greatest point differential in the league.\n\nAnd then, because it\u2019s the Phoenix Suns, the team was able to enjoy that start for less than 24 hours: On Thursday night, the NBA announced a 25-game suspension for Ayton, 2018\u2019s no. 1 overall draft pick, for violating the league\u2019s antidrug policy. The 21-year-old tested positive for a diuretic, a class of substance regulated because it can be used as a masking agent, helping the body remove evidence of other banned substances like steroids before testing. In baseball, for instance, Robinson Can\u00f3 and Michael Pineda were suspended for positive diuretic tests in recent seasons, though Pineda was able to reduce the length of his suspension by successfully arguing he didn\u2019t take the diuretic to hide PED use.\n\nAyton will attempt the same tactic, according to a report from ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. Follow-up tests of Ayton revealed no traces of other banned substances, and the players\u2019 association will try to get the suspension reduced under the CBA\u2019s \u201cunintentional ingestion\u201d provision. But in any case, Thursday\u2019s news puts a damper on the Suns\u2019 early-season efforts.\n\n\u201cThis was an unintentional mistake and unfortunately I put something in my body that I was completely unaware of,\u201d Ayton said in a statement, adding, \u201cI\u2019m extremely disappointed that I\u2019ve let my team down. I will continue to work with the NBPA to go through arbitration and am hopeful of a positive resolution.\u201d\n\nAyton\u2019s case represents big news not only because it takes one of the Suns\u2019 best players off the floor, but also because of its rarity in the NBA; suspensions for antidrug policy violations have been issued infrequently, especially among players of Ayton\u2019s stature. Recent suspensions of this length went to players like Wilson Chandler, Jodie Meeks, and an older Joakim Noah\u2014none of them All-Star\u2013caliber talents like the Phoenix center.\n\nThe 2019-20 campaign is crucial for a Suns team trying to turn the corner on a long stretch of losing. Booker is already in his fifth season, but his team has never won more than 24 games and has by far the NBA\u2019s worst record in that span. For the first time in years, though, the Suns could lay reasonable claim to a viable NBA starting five: Rubio\u2014a real live point guard!\u2014and Booker in the backcourt, flashy forwards in Kelly Oubre Jr. and Dario Saric, and Ayton in the middle. And after trading for established players in Saric and Aron Baynes over the summer, plus drafting 23-year-old Cam Johnson\u2014himself older than Booker\u2014Phoenix signaled an intention to win now, even amid a crowded Western Conference field.\n\nLast season, Ayton was overshadowed by other members of his impressive rookie class, but there was no shame in not matching Luka Doncic highlight for highlight. The 6-foot-11 Sun turned in a promising season of his own, averaging 16.3 points and 10.3 rebounds per game\u2014numbers that, historically, portend not just a long and successful career, but a Hall of Fame one. And on the defensive end, the once-easily-fooled rookie improved to at least playable by the second half of the season; at the very least, he stopped standing flat-footed or getting spun while defending a basic pick-and-roll.\n\nAyton\u2019s gains seemed to continue through the first night of the 2019-20 season, as well. He shot a robust 9-for-14 from the field against Sacramento, blocked a career-high four shots, and posted a plus-25 differential while on the court.\n\nNow, Ayton will have to sit, if not for 25 games then for at least some duration of an important developmental period. Ayton is still learning the cadence of an NBA game, particularly on defense, and he is still learning to coexist with Booker and a relatively unfamiliar cast of starters: Oubre played 40 games for Phoenix after a midseason trade last season, while Rubio and Saric are both new to the team.\n\nEven if its length isn\u2019t reduced, the suspension could prove a mere hiccup in Ayton\u2019s developmental timeline. Twenty-five games matter, but they won\u2019t make or break his career. However, for a franchise in dire need of some extended good news, a suspension for the prospective franchise center\u2019s possible consumption of performance-enhancing drugs is just about the opposite. The Suns took one step forward with a resounding opening-night win, only to take one giant step backward the very next night. Such is the state of affairs in Phoenix for a half-decade running.","similarity":0.9973627925},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/8\/28\/20836659\/team-usa-fiba-world-cup-anticipation","id":20600700,"title":"How Worried Should We Be About Team USA? - The Ringer","description":"Two international basketball enthusiasts discuss the lackluster squad the United States is sending to the FIBA World Cup and what might be ahead if it wins\u2014or loses\u2014the tournament","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/mEqDVWKbjHPVmRgY_Jnd4uVvAis=\/0x0:3000x1571\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19125484\/team_usa_rodger_gonz_getty_ringer.jpg","tags":"Front Page,NBA,Sports","groups":["NBA","Sports"],"author":"Rodger Sherman","date":"2019-08-28T10:25:05-04:00","content":"When the FIBA Basketball World Cup begins in China on Saturday, Team USA will enter the tournament as the favorite. But for the first time in more than a decade, the U.S. is hardly a sure thing to win it all. \n\nIt took more than 50 invitations for USA Basketball to find 15 players willing to attend training camp in Las Vegas in early August. Anthony Davis, James Harden, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Bradley Beal, Kyle Lowry, and Tobias Harris are among a host of big-name players to withdraw from the team along the way. That has made the transition taxing at times for new head coach Gregg Popovich, who takes over after Mike Krzyzewski commanded the bench for 15 years. Over the weekend, Team USA lost to Australia in Melbourne in a warm-up exhibition. It was the first international defeat for a roster of American NBA players in almost 13 years, snapping a 78-game win streak that dated back to the 2006 World Championship. \n\nIn the nearly 70 years of the event, no team has won three straight World Cups. Team USA has a chance to become the first, but it won\u2019t be easy. Our resident international basketball enthusiasts Rodger Sherman and John Gonzalez look at the challenges facing Pop\u2019s squad, what they like about this team, and what has them concerned.  \n\nJohn Gonzalez: OK, Rodger, we should probably start with the much-maligned roster, which is much maligned for a reason. It is, as they say, not great. After Team USA lost to the Boomers\u2014which we will get to\u2014Marc Stein reported that Kyle Kuzma returned to the States for treatment on the left ankle injury he sustained during the Australia friendly. That leaves the following 12 players to accompany Pop to China:\n\nKemba WalkerDonovan MitchellKhris MiddletonHarrison BarnesJayson TatumJaylen BrownMarcus SmartBrook LopezMyles TurnerJoe HarrisDerrick WhiteMason Plumlee\n\nMay God bless America. As our colleague Zach Kram explained, there are lots of reasons to consider this the worst group of professional players Team USA has ever fielded. It should also be noted that if anyone gets injured during the tournament, FIBA rules don\u2019t allow for replacements. They would have to press on with the depleted roster as is. \n\nRodger, what do you make of this bunch? I think they should have just thrown up the emergency Hoodie Melo signal for fun.\n\nRodger Sherman: I expected this roster to be bad, but it\u2019s still upsetting to see it laid out! Last year, 19 Team USA\u2013eligible players were in the All-Star Game. (Twenty if we count Dwyane Wade, which we shouldn\u2019t.) This team has one of those 19 players: Kemba Walker. The good news is that Team USA has won recently with some of these randos on the roster\u2014Mason Plumlee was on the 2014 team that won the World Cup in Spain, Harrison Barnes went to the 2016 Rio Olympics\u2014but both were deep bench players alongside a slew of stars. Both will have to play this time around.\n\nThe flip side, though, is that Team USA has 12 NBA players. Even if some of those NBA players are mid-tier Celtics or Plumlees, they are NBA players. France has five, Australia, Canada, Serbia, and Spain have four, and no other team in the World Cup field has more than three. I know USA basketball has been felled by arrogance in the past, but I do think it\u2019s fair to say that simply having a lot of NBA players is a sign that the United States has the most talented team in the field.\n\nWhen Team USA has lost in the past, it happened because other countries had teams that had played together for years. The gap in talent between Team USA and its competition was overcome by cohesion. That danger exists this time, because, hoo boy, this squad is hastily thrown together.\n\nGonzalez: You\u2019re obviously right that Team USA has more NBA players than any other roster, but more doesn\u2019t necessarily mean better. As you pointed out, a team that is stitched together at the last second can tear apart at inopportune moments.\n\nWhich brings us to the loss to Australia. When Team USA was practicing in L.A. recently, Pop said he planned to neutralize Patty Mills by plying him with too much wine and food. Maybe he should have tried harder. Mills had 13 points in the fourth quarter of that game while Walker and Mitchell\u2014by all accounts the two best players on Team USA during training camp\u2014struggled down the stretch. The Aussie announcers called the win \u201cAustralian basketball history.\u201d Which I guess it is. I checked with Ben Mallis, an Australian journalist I know who covered the Sixers this past season. He said the victory was like if the U.S. men\u2019s soccer team somehow managed to beat Brazil on home soil. People were excited.\n\nAll that is fine, and it\u2019s great for the Boomers and basketball in Australia, but that team is led by Mills, Joe Ingles, Matthew Dellavedova, Aron Baynes, and Andrew Bogut. They also started the game with Jock Landale. No one reading this has any idea whether I made that last name up. \n\nIt should be noted that the U.S. rebounded by beating Canada in its next exhibition outing and finished the World Cup warm-up swing 3-1, with the two other wins coming over Spain and Australia in an earlier exhibition. But, let\u2019s be clear: This Team USA is beatable. \n\nHow concerned are you by that Australia loss? And beyond that, is there anything you actually like about this particular Team USA?\n\nSherman: The Australia loss ... was bad! Team USA did not seem very interested in \u201cpassing\u201d or \u201crunning an offense.\u201d The team had 11 total assists, with Marcus Smart taking the team lead with ... three. This team isn\u2019t as talented as past teams\u2014it absolutely cannot afford to be disorganized and unmotivated as well. But that\u2019s how it felt watching that game. It really did seem like a bunch of players thrown together with no rhyme or reason with little stake in winning or losing.\n\nThat said\u2014it was an exhibition game in front of 52,000 fans and likely the only true road game Team USA will play in this tournament, and it was sandwiched between two convincing wins. \n\nThe funny thing is, I think it might be good for Team USA not to take gold. I\u2019d much prefer a U.S. victory at next year\u2019s Olympics to a win at the FIBA World Cup. If Team USA coasts to an easy win in this tournament despite sending a bored B-team\u2014C-team? D-team? J-team? U-team?\u2014I think that could be a really bad lesson heading into the Olympics. A loss here would remind USA Basketball that it\u2019s possible to lose in international competition and probably convince a fun roster to show up in Tokyo next year. If this team coasts to a win at the FIBA tournament, I can already see Marcus Smart on the bronze medal podium next year. \n\nGonzalez: If it\u2019s good for Team USA to lose, I have excellent news for you. They lost two scrimmages to the select team while they were out here in Los Angeles. There were lots of murmurs that day. One exec who was on hand that day told me they looked \u201clike an AAU team\u2014all individuals trying to do their own thing.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t see this team coasting to anything easy in the tournament. All that said, they are the favorites for a reason. They\u2019re deeper than everyone else\u2014though there will be times, like against Greece and Serbia, when they don\u2019t have the best player on the floor. The big thing for Team USA will be the shooting. If you take out the 2-for-14 performance on 3s against Canada on Monday, they were hitting better than 40 percent from long range in their exhibitions. If they shoot well and play from ahead, I like their chances. (I also like their warm-ups, but not their uniforms.) But if they get into a close game where they\u2019re challenged, which I fully expect to happen, I wonder who the closer will be. I suppose that role will fall to Kemba or Mitchell. Which is \u2026 fine. But they\u2019re not Harden or LeBron or Kobe. I also wonder who will guard guys like Giannis Antetokounmpo or Nikola Jokic in critical big-game situations. The United States has a lot of guards\/wings but not many athletic big bodies.\n\nSo who do you think represents their biggest competition? (Hint, it\u2019s the team that boasted \u201cmay God help them\u201d if the two squads meet.)\n\nSherman: Clearly their biggest competition is the USA Select Team. \n\nMy real take: The U.S. should have sent the G-Leaguers who won the qualifying tournaments to get to the World Cup and won those scrimmages. Maybe they\u2019d win, maybe they\u2019d lose; at least it wouldn\u2019t be an embarrassment either way! \n\nOutside of that, Serbia, which has a legitimate NBA star in Jokic, some decent players surrounding him, and years of competing together. Am I wrong about a loss here serving as a potential wake-up call? Will Team USA be able to get, like, three All-Stars to next year\u2019s Olympics?\n\nMaybe you\u2019re right. Maybe a loss in China would serve as a call to action for all the stars who decided to stay home, tweet out workout videos, and\/or complain about being doubled in pickup games. \n\nGonzalez: Serbia is a legit threat. In addition to Jokic, they have Bogdan Bogdanovic, Nemanja Bjelica, onetime Clipper Milos Teodosic, and everyone\u2019s favorite center\/Chihuahua lover Boban Marjanovic. Greece has Giannis, which automatically makes them a problem, and his brother Thanasis, along with Nick Calathes (three-time Greek League MVP and former Grizzly) and Georgios Papagiannis (who spent a hot second with the Kings). Spain has Rudy Fernandez, Ricky Rubio, Marc Gasol, Willy Hernangomez, and Juancho Hernangomez, all of whom have varying levels of NBA experience and have played together for years. I also wouldn\u2019t overlook France, with Rudy Gobert, Nic Batum, Evan Fournier, and, bless his heart, Frank Ntilikina. Frankie Smokes might even get to play for a change. \n\nThis is a good, crowded field. I\u2019m very much looking forward to the tournament. With Team USA sending a lesser version of itself, it could make the pending proceedings even more entertaining and competitive. Let\u2019s end with predictions, Rodger. You go first. When this is all over, which team will win the 2019 world championships? \n\nSherman: Honestly, I think Team USA will take it. (Setting them up for a cataclysmic loss in 2020?!?!?!!?!?!) \n\nGonzalez: That\u2019s the safe bet. And the patriotic bet. But since I just spent the past two weeks (not to mention this collabo with you) clutching my basketball pearls about this team, I\u2019ll go with the field. I just think there are too many potential potholes, and I\u2019m not sold on Team USA navigating all of them without ending up in a ditch. If I had to pick one specific team to undo them, it\u2019s Serbia. They\u2019re good. Pop didn\u2019t take the bait when he was told about the Serbian coach\u2019s \u201cmay God help them\u201d comments\u2014but at this point, a little divine intervention couldn\u2019t hurt.

Free agency for stars begins two years in advance. Trade scenarios are cooked up as soon as someone signs. Early mock drafts come earlier each year. But are our assumptions about the future of the league\u2019s best and worst teams ever accurate?\n\nWe looked at all teams since 1988-89, the first season with unrestricted free agency, to see how precisely we can pinpoint a team\u2019s future based on its present. The answer? The current NBA landscape predicts the future NBA landscape about as well as Shaquille O\u2019Neal\u2019s MVP season predicted Steph Curry\u2019s.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the basics. We find that a team\u2019s record in a given year (Year X) can explain 44 percent of its record one year later (Year X+1)\u201456 percent can be attributed to other factors. That\u2019s a fair portion, and it far exceeds the predictiveness in other sports. An MLB team\u2019s record explains just 22 percent of its next-year record, and the NFL is at 11 percent.\n\nBut for anything further than one year in the future, a team\u2019s current quality is virtually meaningless. By the third year (Year X+3), a team\u2019s current record can explain just 7 percent of the future; by the fifth year (Year X+5), that\u2019s a measly 1 percent.\n\nThe NBA standings are therefore elastic, meaning they easily change shape over time, and that discovery carries a number of implications for both teams and analysts. For instance, it can explain, in part, why unprotected draft picks traded far in advance often don\u2019t yield the kind of premium selections that teams might hope. Just because, say, the Kings were one of the league\u2019s worst teams when they traded their 2019 first-rounder in 2015 doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019d still be one of the league\u2019s worst teams by the time the pick conveyed; in fact, that pick ended up 14th overall.\n\nSimilarly, it\u2019s easy to dream on this Bucks team, which enjoyed a historically great 2018-19 regular season and features the league\u2019s newest MVP in Giannis Antetokounmpo. But even their future is less certain than those facts would suggest: A slew of crucial contributors\u2014Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Malcolm Brogdon, Nikola Mirotic\u2014are free agents this summer (Brogdon is restricted), so Mike Budenholzer\u2019s roster could look markedly different next season, or else capped out and unable to make meaningful additions going forward. It\u2019s possible the Bucks\u2019 championship plans will dissipate as quickly as they appeared.\n\nTo investigate further, we took a closer look at how well present-day success predicts success over the next five seasons. We split teams into three broad categories: \u201cGood\u201d teams win 50 or more games in a season (or the winning-percentage equivalent in a lockout year), \u201cbad\u201d teams win 30 or fewer games, and \u201cdecent\u201d teams are the mass between. What happens in the next handful of seasons for the teams in each grouping?\n\nGood teams don\u2019t stay good for all that long\u2014not even the full length of a star\u2019s prime. This chart shows the percentage of good teams that stayed good or fell to decent or bad after a certain number of years.\n\nAbout two-thirds of good teams stay good the following year, which is encouraging, but only about half are still good two years later. By four and five years later, only about a third are still good. And that four-and-five-year total includes a number of teams who were good, struggled, and then rebounded, so their championship window wasn\u2019t open that entire time. Overall, only 16 percent of good teams, or one in six, maintain their current quality for each of the next five seasons.\n\nHow do those lessons apply to 2018-19\u2019s good teams? Using the 50-win marker, eight teams qualify: the Bucks, Raptors, Warriors, Nuggets, Rockets, Trail Blazers, 76ers, and Jazz. Within two seasons, we\u2019d expect four of those teams to no longer be good; over the next five seasons, we\u2019d expect just one or two of those teams to stay good the whole time. Even the most carefully crafted long-term team-building plans go awry much more often than not.\n\nBut to their credit, those good teams are also unlikely to collapse immediately. Just six teams have fallen from good to bad\u2014skipping over decent\u2014in the span of a single offseason:\n\nHere\u2019s that same kind of chart for teams that are decent\u2014between 30 and 50 wins\u2014in a given season. \n\nDecent teams tend to stay decent over time\u2014but that\u2019s not much of a revelation, because teams of all stripes trend toward the middle. That\u2019s simple regression to the mean. The more interesting takeaway here is that teams already in the middle are equally as likely to move up in the NBA\u2019s hierarchy as they are to move down.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nBasketball has the least parity of any major U.S. sport, and the NBA has a perception that it\u2019s exceedingly difficult to break into the upper crust. Compared with the league\u2019s own past, however, the last decade has seen healthy competition between a wider swath of teams. From 1980 through 2009, eight franchises combined to win 30 titles. In the 2010s alone, seven teams have won, and 26 of 30 teams have won at least one playoff series. (Apologies to Charlotte, Detroit, Minnesota, and Sacramento.)\n\nThere\u2019s still a fair likelihood that a decent team will become stuck in middling purgatory\u2014not good enough to contend for a title, not bad enough to start a contention cycle anew. But as these results show, teams in the middle aren\u2019t doomed to this fate, either: About half escape within a couple of years, and both directions\u2014up or down\u2014represent a viable alternative.\n\nAnd finally, here\u2019s the precedent for bad teams\u2019 future outlook.\n\nIt looks like the good teams\u2019 chart in reverse. The majority of bad teams stay bad the next season, but within two seasons, more have ascended to decent or good than remained bad; within five seasons, they\u2019re scattered across the spectrum. Look at that X+5 column. It\u2019s not that different from the X+5 column for the good teams\u2014which is just another way of saying that from five years out, there\u2019s not much separation between a team that\u2019s currently near the top of the league and a team that\u2019s currently at the bottom. Their futures look surprisingly similar through a wide-angle lens.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy for bad teams to break through to the top. Merely 35 percent of bad teams enjoy a 50-win campaign at any point in the next five seasons. So even if bad teams escape from the bottom, they\u2019re unlikely to ascend higher than the middle. From New York to Orlando to Sacramento to Phoenix, the league is full of situations that have seemed hopeless at one point or another this decade.\n\nBut five years is a long time, and the NBA also has mechanisms in place to boost parity. The draft, most obviously, allows the worst teams to add the best new players. The salary cap effectively prevents the best teams from retaining their cores year after year. And with shorter contracts and accelerated player movement, there may yet be greater year-to-year fluctuations in team performance. Indeed, splitting the predictiveness results by decade shows that the 2010s saw much starker changes in team performance than the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nSo a bad team isn\u2019t necessarily trapped into its situation any more than a good team is destined to remain good for seasons to come. Poor ownership and management might prove incredible hindrances to team improvement\u2014and indeed, some teams do remain trapped at the bottom for a half-decade or more\u2014but future NBA performance looks kind of random from a present-day perspective. \n\nStatistically, we know basically nothing about which teams will be the league\u2019s best and worst just three years from now. That conclusion fits with what we\u2019re seeing now, too. The Lakers could be a title contender with James and Anthony Davis, or they could struggle with a post-prime LeBron. The Warriors might rely on two 30-something guards. The Bucks will have had to contend with Antetokounmpo\u2019s free agency. Kawhi Leonard might be anywhere. The Kings and Timberwolves might have young stars just rounding into form. And the league\u2019s standings will continue to spin and shift like Curry turning around a screen at the top of the key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","similarity":0.9970831871},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/college-basketball\/2019\/1\/18\/18187476\/zion-williamson-duke-numbers-ncaa-nba-draft","id":17951517,"title":"The Numbers Behind Zion Williamson\u2019s Historic Season - The Ringer","description":"It\u2019s hard to capture the Duke phenom in words, so we tried stats instead","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/5aWozFsFiiRHvh08m9fCMtilK2M=\/0x0:3000x1571\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/13698334\/zion.jpg","tags":"Front Page,NBA Draft,College Basketball,Sports","groups":["College Basketball","NBA Draft","Sports"],"author":"Mike Lynch","date":"2019-01-18T05:40:00-05:00","content":"It\u2019s not supposed to work this way. The most explosive athlete isn\u2019t supposed to be the most well-rounded player on the floor. The guy who might have lost a tooth on the backboard shouldn\u2019t execute fundamentals like a veteran.\n\nBut don\u2019t tell this to Zion Williamson. We\u2019ve never seen an athlete quite like him. You\u2019ve surely heard the Duke freshman\u2019s praises sung a million times by now. But a close look at the data brings the details of Zion\u2019s particular brand of dominance to life. Here\u2019s a close look at just how special one of the most exciting draft prospects in years has been ahead of Saturday\u2019s marquee matchup between the top-ranked Blue Devils and the no. 4 Virginia Cavaliers.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the most discussed aspect of Zion\u2019s game: his athleticism. Thanks to Jared Dubin\u2019s excellent NBA combine database, we can look at various measures of athleticism for every prospect tested since 2000. If you believe the claims that the 6-foot-7, 285-pound Williamson has a 45-inch vertical (I do), he blows away the maximum vertical leaps of every other prospect listed at 240 pounds or more. Only Miles Plumlee and Semi Ojeleye (coincidentally, also former Blue Devils) even cracked 40 inches among the players in this group. Bigs known for being explosive leapers such as Blake Griffin (248 pounds, 35.5-inch max vert) and Dwight Howard (240, 35.5) come up about 40 pounds lighter and 10 inches shy of Williamson. In fact, the only player in the entire database who had a better vert than Williamson was Kansas\u2019s Kenny Gregory, an explosive 6-foot-5 wing who weighed 85 pounds less than Williamson and leaped just half an inch higher.\n\nBut Williamson is more than just an athlete.\n\nSports-Reference\u2019s college basketball database contains statistics for every notable player, plus most of the ones from every major program, dating back to 1947-48. In that time, Williamson\u2019s 68.4 percent effective field goal percentage is the third best posted by any 20-point scorer. Only Keith \u201cMister\u201d Jennings (a 5-foot-7 point guard from East Tennessee State who would later play for Don Nelson\u2019s Golden State Warriors) and Michael Bradley (the center who played one season at Villanova in the early 2000s after transferring from Kentucky) ever posted better numbers.\n\nEffective field goal percentage accounts for the added value of 3-point shots, and thus rewards perimeter shooters like Jennings, who hit an absurd 59.2 percent of 142 3-point attempts in the aforementioned season. If we instead focus on 2-point field goal percentage, Williamson\u2019s 73.9 percent is the second best by any 20 PPG scorer since 1947-48, trailing only Oregon State\u2019s Steve Johnson, who shot 74.6 percent en route to 21 PPG in 1980-81. Johnson, a 23-year-old senior at the time of that feat, went on to have a 10-year NBA career and is the seventh-most-accurate shooter in NBA history. \n\nWilliamson\u2019s historic 2-point shooting is largely driven by his work around the rim. Jeff Haley\u2019s excellent site Hoop-Math has been calculating play-by-play-based shooting stats since 2012. After Monday\u2019s loss to Syracuse, Williamson was 111-for-144 (77.1 percent) on shots at the rim. That\u2019s tied (with Wisconsin\u2019s Ethan Happ) for the most shots made at the rim and is the fifth-best field goal percentage at the rim among players with 100-plus attempts there. The four players ahead of him all had fewer attempts, and also had more than half of their makes at the rim assisted. Williamson is unique in that he\u2019s an incredible finisher, but he also creates a lot of his opportunities at the cup, shedding helpless defenders along the way. He\u2019s been assisted on just 44.1 percent of his 111 makes at the basket.\n\nAmong players with 150-plus field goals made at the rim\u2014a number Williamson is easily on pace to eclipse\u2014who were assisted on fewer than half of their makes, Williamson\u2019s 77.1 percent shooting would be the best since at least 2012. Ben Simmons (2015-16) and T.J. Warren (2013-14) are the only two players meeting those qualifiers over that span to shoot over 75 percent.\n\nZion is filling up the box score with averages of 21.2 points, 9.4 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 2.0 steals, and 1.9 blocks. This gives him a chance to become the only freshman on record to average at least 20-9-2-2-1. If you remove the assists minimum, and lessen the steals minimum to just one, he\u2019s joined by Wayman Tisdale (three-time All-American), Lionel Simmons (National Player of the Year and third-leading scorer in Division I history), Kevin Durant (NBA MVP), Michael Beasley (All-American), and Lamine Diane (fellow 2018-19 freshman having a monster season at Cal State Northridge). Also of note is that Williamson is doing all of this in just 26.8 minutes a game. Of the other players who have averaged at least 20 points, 9 rebounds, 1 steal, and 1 block, regardless of class, each has averaged at least 30 MPG. If Williamson is able to bump his rebounding and shot-blocking numbers just slightly, he could become just the fifth player on record to average at least 20 PPG, 10 RPG, 2 BPG, and 2 SPG. None of the previous four (Lionel Simmons, David Robinson, Ron Harper, or Carey Scurry) did it in a major conference.\n\nIt bears repeating: Williamson is averaging only 26.8 minutes per game. Per Sports-Reference\u2019s college basketball site, no player since Bo Kimble in 1987-88 has averaged 20-plus points in so few minutes. That season, Kimble averaged 22.2 points in 26.3 minutes on a Loyola Marymount team that averaged over 110 points (fourth most in a season in D-I history). Though we don\u2019t have reliable possessions data from 31 years ago, it\u2019s safe to say that Kimble had plenty more scoring opportunities in Paul Westhead\u2019s \u201cSystem\u201d than Williamson does.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive statistics for Williamson are the ones that aim to capture overall value. The Sports-Reference site calculates John Hollinger\u2019s player efficiency rating for all D-I players back to 2009-10. Over that span, he\u2019s the only player with at least 400 minutes played to post a PER over 40.\n\nOffensive and defensive ratings are calculated by Sports-Reference for all college basketball players dating back to 2009-10. Offensive rating estimates the points produced by each player per 100 possessions, while defensive rating estimates the points per 100 possessions each player allows. Williamson has a 134.1 offensive rating and an 80.5 defensive rating. The gap between those numbers is simply astounding. Among players with 20-plus minutes per game since 2009-10, only Anthony Davis in 2011-12 and Cincinnati\u2019s Gary Clark last season have had larger gaps. However, usage rate (the rate at which a player uses offensive possessions) is important context for offensive rating, since high efficiency is more difficult for high-usage players. So it\u2019s important to note that Williamson\u2019s gap is the best on record for a high-usage player.\n\nBox plus-minus, which can be calculated back to 2010-11, might just do the best job when it comes to encapsulating overall value and identifying outstanding players. The stat estimates how much better (or worse) a given player is than the average player over 100 possessions. Williamson is the only player to post a BPM over 20\u2014meaning he\u2019s more than 20 points better than an average player over 100 possessions\u2014and the players behind him on the list are a who\u2019s who of great college basketball players this decade.\n\nDavis, Towns, and Oladipo were each All-NBA players last season. The eye test says it won\u2019t be long before Williamson joins them. And, in this case, the numbers absolutely agree.\n\nMike Lynch is managing stathead at Sports-Reference.com.\n\n\n\n","similarity":0.9949702621},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/7\/22\/20704216\/team-usa-basketball-damian-lillard","id":20468257,"title":"Can Damian Lillard Be Team USA\u2019s Captain America? - The Ringer","description":"NBA stars are pulling out of the pool for the U.S.\u2019s FIBA World Cup team left and right.

Just one month after USA Basketball announced the 20-player pool from which chairman Jerry Colangelo and new head coach Gregg Popovich would pick the roster that will compete in China in September and two weeks before Team USA convenes in Las Vegas for the start of its training camp, five prominent prospective national-teamers have already removed their names from consideration to wear red, white, and blue.\n\nAnthony Davis dropped out first, preferring to spend what remains of his summer preparing to put his best foot forward in his Hollywood debut. Then James Harden did the same, citing the need to get things organized in Houston after the Rockets\u2019 recent roster restructuring. Eric Gordon, CJ McCollum, and Bradley Beal have stepped back, too, removing three knockdown shooters and offensive creators from a U.S. player pool that\u2019s suddenly looking short on both backcourt bodies and international experience.\n\nOnly four members of the U.S. training camp roster have Senior Team experience: Kyle Lowry,  Kevin Love, Andre Drummond, and Harrison Barnes. And Lowry, the only guard of the bunch, just underwent surgery to repair a torn tendon in his left thumb. While he recuperates\u2014he \u201cremains hopeful\u201d he\u2019ll be ready for camp next month and game action in China in September, per ESPN\u2014the U.S. will have only three healthy guards in the mix: Donovan Mitchell, Kemba Walker, and Damian Lillard.\n\nWith versatile forwards like Khris Middleton, and Paul Millsap to help handle the ball, young creators like Jayson Tatum and Kyle Kuzma to help generate offense and floor-spacing shooters like Love, Brook Lopez, P.J. Tucker, and Myles Turner to provide firepower from the frontcourt, there\u2019s still plenty of shot-creating skill and overall talent in the pool, which will be whittled down to a 12-player roster announced August 17. And USA Basketball brass could add some new names to the guard group before breaking camp, perhaps through call-ups from the Select Team of younger players picked to practice against the senior squad in Las Vegas; the 10-player Select Team roster will reportedly include Kings point guard De\u2019Aaron Fox and Clippers sharpshooter Landry Shamet, among others. (Young bigs Marvin Bagley, John Collins, and Mitchell Robinson, have also been invited.)\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nWith or without the sort of signature stars who routinely top the NBA\u2019s MVP ballot, Team USA will still be the favorite to win its third straight FIBA crown, due partly to the fact that we\u2019ve seen this movie before. The 2010 team that won FIBA gold in Turkey featured zero holdovers from the U.S. roster that had won Olympic gold in China two summers earlier. The 2014 team that won it all in Spain had only two players who\u2019d suited up in the 2012 Summer Games: Harden and Davis, who saw the least playing time of any members of the U.S. squad in London. Despite lacking marquee superstars, those teams bested their international counterparts thanks in part to stellar performances by younger players rising to seize the opportunity to take on larger roles. A 21-year-old Kevin Durant won tournament MVP in 2010; a 22-year-old Kyrie Irving earned the honor in 2014.\n\nTatum, who turned 21 in March, and Mitchell, who will turn 23 midway through the World Cup, could fit the bill as rising young talents given a greater chance to shine. This time around, though, it seems like the stage is set for a previously overlooked older head to prevail.\n\nAfter being cut from the final roster in 2014 and withdrawing from consideration in 2016, Lillard has gone on to become one of the sport\u2019s premier point guards. He\u2019s finished in the top six in MVP voting in each of the last two seasons, earned consecutive All-NBA berths, and established himself as a clutch assassin and Pacific Northwest legend by drilling one of the most iconic shots in NBA postseason history. After leading the Trail Blazers to their deepest postseason run in 19 years, Lillard agreed to a supermax contract extension\u2014four years, $196 million\u2014to cement himself as Portland\u2019s cornerstone for the next half-decade and as one the NBA\u2019s true superstars.\n\nWith Harden and Davis both bowing out, there\u2019s room for a star to take the reins of Team USA. Why not Lillard, a man seemingly in the midst of A Moment, whose earning power and Q rating are both on the rise, who has yet to get a crack at wearing a U.S. uniform in international competition, and who seems to perfectly fit the bill for what Pop\u2019s roster needs most after the recent defections: an ace scorer, a top 3-point shooter, a primary ball handler, and a bona fide leader?\n\n\u201cFor me, I\u2019ve had a lot of accomplishments\u2014high school, college, and even in the NBA,\u201d Lillard recently told reporters at his summer camp. \u201cBut the ultimate goal is to win it all, to win the championship as a team. As an individual, you want to be MVP. So, I think that\u2019s an easy question. I haven\u2019t been either one of those\u2014a champion or MVP\u2014so there\u2019s a lot I still have to play for, a lot to keep me going.\u201d\n\nA first career gold medal seems like something to play for. The chance to win it while stepping forward as the All-Star who stuck around while his peers stayed home\u2014to win it all and be the MVP, not for club, but for country\u2014seems like it\u2019d keep Lillard going and be a hell of a capper to what\u2019s been a massive summer. It\u2019s probably not easy to find the right role to take on next after suiting up for Space Jam 2. Captain America\u2019s got a pretty nice ring to it.\n\n","similarity":0.9941619635},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2020\/7\/27\/21337647\/three-interesting-takeaways-nba-restart-schedule","id":21101688,"title":"The Three Most Interesting Parts of the NBA Restart Schedule   - The Ringer","description":"The Pelicans have it easy, the Lakers have it hard, and the Nets and Wizards have \u2026 no players","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/rIt4UQrJ-UONactYFEp7b0zxJh4=\/0x0:1200x628\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/20532993\/NBARestartSchedule_Getty_Ringer.jpg","tags":"Front Page,NBA,Sports","groups":["NBA","Sports"],"author":"Rodger Sherman","date":"2020-07-27T06:10:00-04:00","content":"The first thing the NBA had to do to return in the midst of a pandemic was, obviously, figure out how to deal with the pandemic\u2014create a bubble, source routine testing, create protocols for what would happen if a player got sick, and, apparently, purchase enough fishing equipment for the entire NBA to go fishing every single day. The second thing was to figure out what the competitive format of the return would look like. Sports leagues have developed their competitive structures over decades\u2014how would they deal with a sudden five-month-long gap right in the middle of their season? Baseball hadn\u2019t started yet, so MLB just decided to play a shortened season. MLS decided to play a special one-off tournament in the middle of its season, and is supposedly planning to continue with the rest of its regular season afterward. The NHL cut straight to the playoffs, but an expanded version that features 24 of the league\u2019s 31 teams. \n\nThe NBA took the most convoluted path of all. When the regular season stopped on March 11, just about the entire playoff picture had been figured out. There was a clear gap between the eighth and final playoff team in each conference and the ninth seed\u2014in the East, the Magic had a 5.5-game lead on the Wizards; in the West, the Grizzlies had a 3.5-game lead on the Trail Blazers, Pelicans, and Kings. And the 1-seed in each conference had a commanding five-game lead on each 2-seed. Some of the teams in between 2 and 7 were tightly packed, but that wasn\u2019t too big of a deal. After all, one of the biggest incentives to improve their seeding after qualifying for the playoffs is so that they can win home-court advantage \u2026 which will not exist with every team in the Orlando bubble playing games on the same courts in front of no fans. \n\nThe league probably could have cut straight to the postseason bracket. Instead, the NBA invited the 16 teams in postseason spots plus six additional teams within six games of the final spot in each conference, and will have each team play eight games to determine playoff seeding. If after these eight games the 9-seed in either conference is within four games of the 8-seed, it will trigger a play-in tournament where the 9-seed can qualify for the postseason by winning two games while the 8-seed can eliminate the 9-seed by winning once. (Remember what I said about it being convoluted?) \n\nIt\u2019s strange. It feels like the NBA should have tried to make the bubble as small as possible because of the ridiculously complex logistics of the situation and the ethics of using COVID tests to ensure safe gameplay while our nation\u2019s capacity to test for the disease remains limited. But the league chose to add about a hundred extra players and countless personnel and to extend the process by several weeks, just for the relatively small chance that a 9-seed could overtake the 8-seed before inevitably being crushed by the 1-seed. But since they\u2019re playing, here are the things that stand out most to me about the schedule:\n\nSince only teams in the playoff hunt were invited to the Disney bubble, most of them are good. And yet somehow, one of the teams in the field is scheduled to play eight opponents with a combined winning percentage below .500. While the NBA invited 22 teams to Disney, it feels like the 8-game run-up to the postseason can be made interesting by only one: The New Orleans Pelicans, whose schedule has set them up perfectly for a furious dash to the 8-seed.  \n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nSix of New Orleans\u2019s eight opponents have records below .500. The Pellies will play the most cursed rosters in Orlando. They have games against the Wizards and Nets, both sub-.500 teams missing at least three of their best players; they have a game against the Spurs, who are four games out of the playoff chase and without their best player; they have two games against the Kings, who actually have the same record as New Orleans, but have seen their roster decimated by injuries and positive COVID tests; New Orleans\u2019s two games against actual good teams (the Jazz and Clippers) are its first two games, meaning the Pelicans will likely be playing the Wizards, Spurs, and at least one of their games against the Kings after those teams have already been eliminated from postseason contention. Plus, they have a game against the Grizzlies, the team ahead of them in the 8-slot. If they beat Memphis, it\u2019s possible for them to actually surpass the Grizzlies in the standings by the end of the eight-game seeding schedule, allowing them to play the play-in games as the 8-seed instead of the 9-seed.\n\nHow did they get this incredible schedule? Well, they already had it. The restart schedules are made up of games that were already on teams\u2019 regular-season schedules, except without all the teams that didn\u2019t make the Disney cut. New Orleans had a massively front-loaded schedule\u2014it had the toughest strength of schedule in the NBA before the All-Star break, but only three of its 18 remaining scheduled games were against a team over .500. As it turns out, New Orleans\u2019s eight-game schedule is actually, on the whole, tougher than the remaining games it had when the original schedule was canceled\u2014by weeding out matchups against teams like the Knicks and Hawks, the average winning percentage of the Pelicans\u2019 remaining opponents bumped from .441 to .495. But that sub-.500 strength of schedule in a field composed of playoff-bound and semi-playoff-adjacent rosters is still incredible.\n\nIf I had to give one competitive reason the NBA should have an eight-game run-up to the playoffs, it\u2019s the fact that canceling the end of the regular season was unfair to New Orleans. In March, with budding megastar Zion Williamson back from injury and a highly favorable schedule, the Pelicans arguably should have been favored to make the playoffs even though they were 3.5 games down on the Grizzlies with under 20 games to go. At the time, FiveThirtyEight gave New Orleans a 60 percent chance to qualify for the postseason, despite the big deficit. With the new format, that\u2019s dropped to 48 percent. But even though their road is harder than it would\u2019ve been, the Pellies are the team this eight-game restart is hypothetically meant for. \n\nBecause every team\u2019s schedule consists of already-existing games, most teams\u2019 strengths of schedule stayed roughly the same. The Nuggets had the third-toughest remaining schedule of the 22 teams before the season was canceled, and now they have the fourth toughest; the Sixers had the second easiest before the season was canceled, and now they still have the second easiest.\n\nCumulative opponent winning percentage, old schedule (at the time the season was suspended) vs. new schedule. pic.twitter.com\/46L1z1HHH7\n\nThere\u2019s been only one big jump\u2014and it\u2019s affecting the team that NBA fans are probably most eager to see: LeBron James and Anthony Davis\u2019s Los Angeles Lakers. Under the original schedule, the Lakers were slated to ease into the postseason, thanks to a comically easy Chicago\u2013Golden State\u2013Minnesota-Sacramento-Phoenix finish. But now that those games have been wiped off the board, the Lakers are left with one of the toughest schedules in the tournament. The top-seeded team in the West will play the Clippers, Nuggets, Jazz, Thunder, and Rockets\u2014the teams in the 2-6 spots in the Western Conference, plus the 2-seed from the East in the Raptors. The only team they will play that\u2019s not in a playoff spot right now is the Kings.\n\nThe question is, how will LeBron and the Lakers handle this run? On the one hand, they\u2019ll want to tune up after four months without basketball. They\u2019ll want to actually compete in these games to get into game shape before the playoffs. On the other, the Lakers don\u2019t really have anything to play for\u2014they\u2019re 5.5 games clear of the Clippers for the 1-seed, and being the 1-seed really doesn\u2019t matter in a competition with no home-court advantage\u2014and they probably won\u2019t want to reveal too much of their strategy considering they\u2019re playing every single team they could potentially play in between the second round and the Finals. The Lakers\u2019 eight-game restart could be a fantastic preview of just about any meaningful Western Conference playoff series, or they could just chill.\n\nThere are two teams in Orlando that bear absolutely no resemblance to functional NBA squads. One is the Washington Wizards, who should have been allowed to stay at home. They\u2019re 5.5 games out of the playoffs, and will be without their three best players. Bradley Beal, who was second in the league averaging 30.5 points per game this year, is skipping the restart due to a rotator cuff injury; John Wall remains out with an Achilles tear suffered during the 2018-19 season; Davis Bertans opted out of the restart due to the Wizards\u2019 unlikelihood of making the playoffs, his injury history, and his upcoming free agency. In March, the Wizards were already the worst team in the field, and over the last four months they got worse. Their most commonly used lineup of the players they\u2019re sending to Orlando played only 15 minutes together this season; it features deep reserve rookies Garrison Mathews and Anzejs Pasecniks. \n\nThe other nonfunctional squad is the Brooklyn Nets, the 7-seed in the East. Brooklyn also has been decimated by injuries: Like Wall, Kevin Durant is still out with an Achilles tear sustained during the 2019 Finals; Kyrie Irving had season-ending shoulder surgery; Spencer Dinwiddie and Taurean Prince tested positive for COVID-19. Durant, Irving, and Dinwiddie were the team\u2019s three best players, and Prince was fourth on the team in minutes played. The Nets brought in Jamal Crawford and Michael Beasley to shore things up, but then Beasley tested positive for COVID too. Irving and Dinwiddie are the team\u2019s two primary point guard options. Without them, they\u2019ll be forced to give some point guard minutes to Crawford (40 years old and not exactly a traditional point guard) and Chris Chiozza (a G-Leaguer cut in December by \u2026 the Wizards).\n\nBoth of these teams are abominations. FiveThirtyEight says the Wizards\u2019 and Nets\u2019 current rosters would win 26 and 32 games, respectively, in an 82-game season, but I feel like that\u2019s being generous\u2014I don\u2019t think FiveThirtyEight\u2019s algorithms are capable of capturing what an NBA offense will look like when it doesn\u2019t have a point guard. The Nets lost their first Orlando scrimmage 99-68, with Dzanan Musa leading the way with 11 points. \n\nWe are blessed. These two teams play each other in the second game of the restart. And if Washington wins that game, it\u2019ll only need to be one game better than the Nets over the other seven games to force a play-in. And that\u2019s basically what I\u2019m rooting for: Three games between these two squads that barely seem like NBA teams. The winner gets to play Giannis Antetokounmpo.

This year\u2019s was no exception: The Warriors and Timberwolves swapped two max contract players in D\u2019Angelo Russell and Andrew Wiggins, the Lakers and Clippers competed for the same target, and the Rockets went all in on super small ball. Sufficient drama reigned throughout the week.\n\nCheck out all of The Ringer\u2019s coverage of the 2020 NBA trade deadline\n\nBut the unspoken secret of the NBA trade deadline is that the frenzied final hours rarely yield meaningful changes to the playoff picture. Writing about this phenomenon two seasons ago, I found that no champion since the 2005 Spurs, with Nazr Mohammed, had won the Finals after adding a player to its playoff rotation via midseason trade. The Raptors sated that drought last season after trading for Marc Gasol, but such examples are eminently rare.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s still too early to determine whether Marcus Morris, Robert Covington, or other deadline-week acquisitions will follow in Gasol\u2019s path, that optimistic outcome is not particularly likely. In fact, the numbers suggest they won\u2019t make any real difference at all.\n\nIn the week leading up to the trade deadline, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s projection system gave 11 teams at least a 1 percent chance to reach the Finals. Here\u2019s how their odds moved from last Sunday to this Sunday.\n\nThat\u2019s barely any movement for anybody. Changes of this magnitude are more likely the result of rounding, or the statistical noise that comes from lumping a bunch of simulations together, than any actual differences. (For those questioning the 76ers\u2019 robust odds: FiveThirtyEight\u2019s model is built on individual player projections, so it thinks quite highly of Philadelphia\u2019s collection of stars\u2014especially when projecting the playoffs, when rotations tighten.)\n\nThe same muted pattern appears when looking at odds of winning the championship, rather than making the Finals: No team\u2019s chances moved by more than 2 percentage points in any direction, with the Lakers (21 percent), Bucks (20 percent), and Clippers (18 percent) still clustered at the top. FiveThirtyEight basically doesn\u2019t think the deadline moves wrought any measurable changes to the title race.\n\nDigging further into the actual trades made last week helps illuminate why. First, many of the most notable transactions involved teams with no chance at a Finals appearance, so they went from 0 percent odds before the deadline to 0 percent odds after.\n\nHere are the dozen players traded this month with the highest 2019-20 cap hits. Only two\u2014with bolded names\u2014went to a team with a winning record:\n\nThe deadline\u2019s most expensive trade, which swapped Wiggins and Russell, involved the two worst teams in the West, and Minnesota also received Turner and Johnson. Three of the players on this list, meanwhile, went to the two worst teams in the East (Atlanta and Cleveland)\u2014so a full half of the players here went to the very bottom of the standings.\n\nEven the players who did join winning clubs might not boost their teams as much as their names suggest. The Clippers are already so formidable on the wings that Morris won\u2019t be in a position to make a huge impact, especially given that his primary strengths overlap with those of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. \n\nThe same idea seems true in Miami. Basically every player in the Heat\u2019s rotation was already average or better, so the similarly rated Iguodala isn\u2019t much of an upgrade. (The same goes for Jae Crowder, who accompanied Iggy to Miami but is shooting just 29 percent from range this year and now might steal minutes from the Heat\u2019s pinpoint marksmen.) Plus, given that Iguodala is 36 years old and hasn\u2019t played all season, it\u2019s unclear how many minutes he\u2019ll play for Miami, which further dilutes his anticipated impact.\n\nZooming out, we can see the lack of top-of-the-standings movement in projections for the rest of the regular season. Comparing FiveThirtyEight\u2019s analysis from last week to now, only five teams have a projected win total that\u2019s more than one game different, in either direction.\n\nHere, we see the impact of some deadline trades: a decline from the Wolves, who didn\u2019t just trade Wiggins but also other rotation players like Covington, and a slight uptick for the Hawks, now with capable centers on the roster.\n\nThese changes also bake in the actual game results of the past week. The Knicks traded Morris, their leading scorer, but also embarked on an unexpected win streak that bumped up their projected win total. Meanwhile, the Pacers stood pat at the deadline but lost every game they played last week.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nIncredibly, Indiana is the only playoff team on that chart. No other contender saw its rest-of-season outlook nudge in a real way, positively or negatively. Instead, all the best teams added complementary players or deep depth pieces (like the 76ers\u2019 new backup wings and the Nuggets\u2019 new benchwarmers) or nobody at all: The Bucks, Lakers, Raptors, Celtics, and Jazz were all inactive at the deadline, though the Bucks appear poised to add Marvin Williams from the buyout market.\n\nIn the middle of the league\u2019s standings, it\u2019s no surprise that teams\u2019 fortunes don\u2019t appear to have changed much either. Neither race for the no. 8 seed received a jolt from a surprise addition. This chart shows the before and after for the nine teams that are neither a playoff lock (greater than 99 percent probability) nor a definite playoff miss (less than 1 percent probability), per FiveThirtyEight.\n\nIn fact, the team with the greatest change didn\u2019t make a deadline deal at all\u2014the Spurs went 0-4 last week, which dropped them from 1.5 games back of the West\u2019s eighth seed to four games back and harmed them more than any trade could. Whether these particular probabilities seem accurate or not\u2014Memphis\u2019s look low, and the model projects Portland and New Orleans to have stronger rosters for the last chunk of the season\u2014it\u2019s clear that no wannabe playoff team moved the needle much on the trade market.\n\nOf course, contenders aren\u2019t the only teams potentially angling for midseason change. For teams at the opposite end of the standings, it might be advantageous to make the roster worse to facilitate a second-half swoon and better lottery position. A bit more movement appeared in this area at the 2020 deadline; FiveThirtyEight now projects the bottom of the standings to finish as follows, compared to the same projection a week ago.\n\nThe Cavaliers are projected for the league\u2019s worst record (and point differential) despite trading for Drummond. But the Warriors kept that race close with their selling spree, while the Timberwolves entered the race for a bottom-three finish\u2014a crucial barrier because the league\u2019s new lottery odds give the worst three teams the same 14 percent chance at the no. 1 pick. Most other subtle differences on this chart are the result of game results in the past week, like the Knicks\u2019 wins (plus some statistical noise, surely).\n\nOverall, though, all of these changes seem relatively minor. Unlike in baseball, which sees the eventual champion add a crucial player every summer\u2014Daniel Hudson, who recorded the final outs of the Nationals\u2019 World Series win last year, joined the team on deadline day\u2014the NBA is far more sparing with its deadline differences. At least from the outset, this season\u2019s deadline looks just as light on impact.

Although offensive efficiency typically nosedives after long layoffs\u2014either due to a lockout or a generic offseason\u2014the league\u2019s average offensive rating actually rose in the seeding games, as compared with the pre-shutdown regular season. And now, with the playoffs more than halfway over, we can examine the postseason data to check whether the Disney gyms really are for hoopers.\n\nWhether due to better defenses, better scouting, fatigue, or all of the above, 3-point accuracy drops in the playoffs every season, by around 2 percentage points leaguewide. But so far this postseason, the league is shooting slightly better on 3s. The improvement is small and might regress as the postseason continues, but it\u2019s meaningful when contrasted with the alternative. Here\u2019s how the past half-decade compares to the 2019-20 postseason.\n\n(Note: To calculate these regular-season percentages, I weighted players\u2019 regular-season attempts proportionally by their playoff attempts. That\u2019s important for an apples-to-apples comparison because better shooters make up more of the player pool in the playoffs. In the 2015-16 postseason, for instance, Klay Thompson and Steph Curry combined to take 10 percent of the whole league\u2019s 3s; in the regular season, they were at just 2.6 percent.)\n\nInterestingly, playoff shooting tends to suffer on both wide-open attempts (defined by NBA Advanced Stats as when the closest defender is at least 6 feet away) and more contested attempts. Yet this season, playoff shooting has ticked up in both categories, most prominently on open 3s.\n\nThese aren\u2019t major differences; a gap of 2.5 percentage points of accuracy between what normally happens in the playoffs and what\u2019s happening this season means only one extra make out of every 40 shots. But with teams averaging about 40 3s per game, even this small difference matters.\n\nIndeed, 3-pointers are flying like never before. (It seems like we could write that sentence every month at this point.) A whopping 43 percent of shots this postseason come from 3-point range\u2014a massive increase even over previous highs. The league\u2019s 3-point attempt rate usually rises a small amount in the playoffs, but the gap between regular-season and postseason rate has never been higher than it is right now.\n\nThe league\u2019s offensive gains over past postseasons aren\u2019t limited to 3-point range, though that\u2019s where the strongest evidence lies. As I\u2019ve written previously, the playoff percentage drop is not exclusive to 3-pointers; free throw and 2-point accuracy tends to fall, too. This postseason, the decline in free throw accuracy is still present, but the 2-point drop is a lot less severe.\n\nWhile on the subject of 2-pointers, excuse a quick aside about the midrange, as teams like the Rockets and Bucks struggle to score against set defenses. Offensive diversity matters. But it\u2019s also worth considering that the teams with the most midrange attempts per game this postseason are the Magic, Trail Blazers, and 76ers, while the most accurate midrange teams are the Mavericks and Thunder. All five clubs lost in the first round.\n\nWhy is playoff shooting better\u2014or at least not worse\u2014than it was in the regular season? Numerous theories abound, and so much has changed this postseason that it\u2019s impossible to isolate any one variable. Here are just a few, any of which might mean nothing on its own but could explain all or part of this phenomenon:\n\nThis last theory is worth further consideration, because while the NBA certainly hopes never to eliminate travel completely again\u2014travel, of course, is necessary to play games in front of home fans, which contributes vast sums to the league\u2019s bottom line\u2014it can at least work to reduce the miles that teams amass over a season. Jazz vice president Dennis Lindsey, whose team ranked first in 3-point percentage in both the regular season and postseason, said Wednesday that he thinks the lack of travel has improved play inside the bubble\u2014and that players seem to agree. \u201cThe players feel better, and frankly, we need to listen to the players,\u201d he told ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon. To translate that impulse to a normal season, Lindsey suggested reducing travel, which could perhaps be accomplished with consecutive games held against the same team in the same arena, like in baseball. \n\nMeanwhile, back in the playoff bubble, players are reaping the benefits of staying put. These 10 players have made the most playoff 3-pointers above what they would have expected to make, based on their regular-season rates and distribution of open and contested 3s. Four players from the rollicking Denver-Utah first-round series appear in the top five, which helps explain why that seven-gamer was so enthralling.\n\nConversely, here are the 10 greatest underperformers so far. The Clippers are title favorites even with their two stars shooting worse than expected.\n\nThe 2019-20 postseason isn\u2019t over yet, so these numbers still have room to slide around, and any movement is worth monitoring\u2014both for the current championship race and the league\u2019s future decisions around, say, travel and crowd proximity to the court. But at this point, it\u2019s difficult to envision a complete reversion to the playoff norm. The postseason is already more than halfway over, and the gyms still belong to the hoopers.\n\nStatistics through Tuesday\u2019s games.

She\u2019d been to the WNBA Finals twice before\u2014first in 2014 with the Chicago Sky, and again last year, her first appearance with the Washington Mystics\u2014and gotten injured both times. She played through the pain twice; her teams got swept twice. \n\nShe and the Mystics hoped this year would be different\u2014that she could stay healthy and lead the organization to its first Finals victory. But just one minute into Game 2 against the Sun, Delle Donne left with yet another injury. \u201cIt didn\u2019t look good,\u201d coach Mike Thibault said after the game, which his team lost 99-87. As it turned out, Delle Donne had herniated three disks in her back. Three disks! Honestly, I didn\u2019t even know my back had multiple disks to herniate. \n\nNevertheless, she got buckets. She didn\u2019t miss any more games, and Thursday night, after the Mystics\u2019 89-78 win in Game 5, Delle Donne went to sleep with the trophy.\n\nelena delle donne slept with the trophy hahahaha pic.twitter.com\/AOLIhU3shZ\n\nIt was clear that the Mystics were the best team in the league this season. Delle Donne recorded the WNBA\u2019s first 50-40-90 season and was named league MVP in a runaway. The shooter-stacked Mystics were the greatest offensive team in league history. They led the WNBA in field goal percentage despite shooting 116 more 3s than any other team and won 13 of their 34 regular-season games by at least 20 points. Ahead of the playoffs, ESPN\u2019s Kevin Pelton projected them to have an 84 percent chance of winning the championship. \n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nBut what made this year\u2019s playoffs so great is that the WNBA isn\u2019t a league where people show up to the gym and say \u201cOh, you\u2019re the best team? That\u2019s cool\u2014here\u2019s your title.\u201d Top women\u2019s players generally get paid more by overseas teams\u2014which play during the fall and winter months\u2014than they do by their WNBA franchises. I bring that up not to get into a long conversation about whether WNBA players deserve more (they do) but just to remind you that all these players essentially give up their summer vacations because they want to play against all the other best players in the world and beat their asses. Nobody got out of the way when they heard the Mystics were coming. They strapped on brass knuckles, picked up baseball bats, and then strapped brass knuckles onto the ends of their baseball bats just for good measure.\n\nIn the semifinals, the Las Vegas Aces\u2014who have the last three no. 1 picks on their roster and Liz Cambage, who set the WNBA\u2019s all-time single game scoring record last year\u2014pushed the Mystics to the wire in Game 1 and then whupped Washington by 17 in Game 3. Cambage scored 28 points in the contest, shot 10-for-11 from the paint, and afterward told the Mystics to \u201cget in the weight room or get out of the post.\u201d Washington won the series in Game 4\u2014and the players responded to Cambage\u2019s zing with some on-court pushups.\n\nAfter game three: Liz Cambage tells the Mystics they need to get in the weight room or get out of the post. After game four: Natasha Cloud does push ups on the Aces court after ending Cambage's season pic.twitter.com\/Z7kcZLFxbd\n\nNext, they had to face the Connecticut Sun, who spent the Finals playing like the Mystics had personally wronged each and every one of them. Jonquel Jones could\u2019ve repeated Cambage\u2019s zing after her 32-point, 18-rebound game in Connecticut\u2019s Game 2 win. Alyssa Thomas, who played through torn labrums in both of her shoulders, had two double-doubles with rebounds, one double-double with assists, and nearly had a triple-double in Game 3. \n\nBut the Mystics countered with more weapons than just Delle Donne. In fact, the team is so deep that the Finals MVP came off the bench. \n\nEmma Meesseman, a Belgian backup center, had some decent moments in her WNBA career up to this season. She was an All-Star in 2015 and led the league in 3-point shooting in 2016. But she definitely wasn\u2019t expected to carry the Mystics. After skipping the 2018 season to play internationally, she\u2019d returned in a reserve role this year. \n\nIn the playoffs, though, she transformed into something unstoppable. Meesseman had been the team\u2019s leading scorer in just three of their regular-season games; she led the Mystics in four of their six playoff wins. She shot 11-for-17 from 3 in the Las Vegas series, and 7-for-14 in the Finals. But she\u2019s also 6-foot-4 and used her deft shooting touch to torture defenders inside the arc as well.\n\nBut even with Meesseman\u2019s outsize bench production and the rest of the team\u2019s shooting capabilities, the Mystics needed Delle Donne. When she is at her best, she is the world\u2019s best\u2014and she makes her team unbeatable. She scored 20-plus points in 15 regular-season games; the Mystics were 15-0 in those games. (They were also 0-3 in games she missed, and 0-2 in games where she played a single minute, including Game 2 of the Finals.) \n\nAfter Game 2, Delle Donne returned with games of 13 and 11 points, her two lowest point totals of the postseason. But in the biggest game of the year\u2014the one that would determine whether she would finally be a champion\u2014she brought it. The Sun did everything they could to keep Delle Donne waiting, pushing Washington to the edge in a game that had nine lead changes. They even took a brief lead in the fourth quarter. But Delle Donne wasn\u2019t going to wait another 12 months.\n\nDelle Donne\u2019s 50-40-90 line tells you that she\u2019s the best shooter in the league\u2019s history, so maybe you\u2019d assume that with an aching back and a busted knee and a masked face, she hung out between the 3-point arcs and provided moral support. Nah. She played a critical role on the boards and on defense, recording a team-high nine rebounds and two blocks, one of which came against Jones. And all eight of her made field goals came in the paint. She needed this title, and she fought for it.\n\nDominance is fascinating, and the Mystics were certainly dominant this year. But sports peak when the best players and the best teams are pushed to the brink. We already knew the Mystics were one of the best teams in WNBA history after the regular season, but the playoffs showed how much Washington was willing to fight to prove it.","similarity":0.9934054613},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/9\/11\/20860968\/team-usa-france-fiba-world-cup-quarterfinal-loss","id":20625009,"title":"Team USA Lost the FIBA World Cup.

Everybody knew a roster lacking the incandescent offensive talents of the post\u2013Redeem Team era\u2014no Kobes, LeBrons, Durants, Kyries, Hardens, ADs, or Stephs\u2014would struggle to score against the best international defenses, and that getting enough stops to carry the day would be a tall order when the best player on the floor wasn\u2019t wearing a U.S. jersey. What happened Wednesday in Dongguan, then, wasn\u2019t a shock or a fluke; it was something we all could see coming since July.\n\nBut seeing something coming doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re ready for it. The onrushing headlights are only helpful if you can get off the train tracks; this U.S. team couldn\u2019t, as Wednesday brought the impact for which we\u2019d all been bracing: an 89-79 quarterfinal loss to France. With Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier leading the way, the French squad roundly outplayed the Americans for three of four quarters, closed the game with a 20-5 run over the final 6:59, and handed a U.S. team featuring NBA players its first nonexhibition loss in 58 international tournaments, dating to the 2006 FIBA World Championship. France advances to take on Argentina in the semifinals; the U.S. will play Serbia in the consolation bracket. Streak snapped, medal hopes dashed, disappointment complete, cycle still in spin.\n\n.@RudyGobert27 was DOMINANT in @ffbasketball's    historic win over USA: 21 points, 16 rebounds, 3 blocks!#FranceGotGame #FIBAWC pic.twitter.com\/VxrYr156Q1\n\nThe weakest spot on this U.S. roster was its frontcourt rotation, and Gobert spotlighted that shortcoming. The Utah Jazz star set crunching screens and dove hard to the rim to create space for France\u2019s ball handlers to attack in the pick-and-roll, helping Fournier, Nando De Colo, and Frank Ntilikina combine for 51 points on 18-of-36 shooting. He beat smaller U.S. defenders on switches and bullied them under the basket, grabbing seven offensive rebounds, getting to the foul line 10 times, and pouring in 21 points, his highest-scoring performance in the tournament.\n\nLate in the game, with the U.S. scrambling to staunch the bleeding, Gobert showed why he\u2019s the NBA\u2019s reigning back-to-back Defensive Player of the Year. Playing with a little extra oomph after U.S. center Myles Turner, who finished fifth in DPOY voting last season, fired a broadside at his bona fides, the 7-foot-1 \u201cStifle Tower\u201d took control of the paint, altering one driving layup by Kemba Walker, blocking another, and coming up with a massive swat on Jazz teammate Donovan Mitchell to keep France up by four with 53 seconds to go.\n\nRUDY GOBERT BLOCKS UTAH JAZZ TEAMMATE DONOVAN MITCHELL FOR HIS 3RD BLOCK OF THE GAME AND THIS MIGHT BE IT pic.twitter.com\/G6kYaObMIA\n\nGobert dominated Turner, who\u2019d been the best U.S. center in this tournament, but who seemed alternatively too tentative and too frenetic in this marquee matchup Wednesday. The Indiana Pacers big man struggled in pick-and-roll defense early, failed to make a mark with the ball in his hands, and barely played after halftime, finishing with more combined turnovers and fouls (five) than points, rebounds, and blocks (three) in 10 feckless minutes. With Brook Lopez looking uncomfortable on defense and missing both of his 3-point tries\u2014continuing a brutal run that\u2019s seen him go 2-of-14 from distance in China\u2014and Mason Plumlee again an afterthought in the rotation, head coach Gregg Popovich went small after France opened up Team USA\u2019s first 10-point deficit of the World Cup in the third quarter.\n\nIt worked. Lineups featuring Harrison Barnes and Jaylen Brown up front, with heavy doses of Mitchell, Marcus Smart, and Derrick White in the backcourt, cranked up both the defensive pressure and the offensive tempo, spreading the floor and attacking the rim. With Smart tilting the game with his trademark activity and defensive skill\u2014he bodied Fournier up top and Gobert down low on switches, notching deflections and snaring offensive rebounds\u2014and Mitchell carrying the offense, the U.S. ripped off a 20-9 run to regain the lead, heading into the final frame with a 66-63 edge.\n\n.@spidadmitchell   punches the tomahawk as @usabasketball    tie it up! #USAFRA  https:\/\/t.co\/U6RPjx3FuZ pic.twitter.com\/SXOoBJhWDU\n\nThe U.S. pushed the lead to seven against a reserve-heavy lineup early in the fourth, but French head coach Vincent Collet put his best lineup back on the floor around the eight-minute mark, and everything flipped. Gobert started controlling the game on both ends. Fournier got loose, and de Colo got to the foul line. Ntilikina, the New York Knicks\u2019 much-maligned 2017 lottery pick, continued his strong World Cup performance by drilling a pair of clutch late jumpers. Team USA did itself no favors by missing seven of 11 fourth-quarter free throws and turning the ball over three times in the final 3:07, but France earned the win \u2026 and the U.S. got the result it deserved.\n\nAfter a balanced scoring attack carried the U.S. through group play, you got the sense that Pop\u2019s club would need a star performance when facing the top competition. Through three quarters, Mitchell fit the bill; his 29 points tied Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Alonzo Mourning for the 10th-highest-scoring individual performance in U.S. World Cup history. In the fourth, though, it was Walker\u2014who had scored just three points through the game\u2019s first 30 minutes\u2014who tried to take the reins. Walker was Team USA\u2019s steadiest contributor and most dangerous creator for most of the tournament, but just couldn\u2019t find the range against the length of Ntilikina and Gobert, and never located his rhythm. He missed two of three free throw attempts after pump-faking his way to the foul line with the U.S. down six in the final minute, icing the game and ensuring that there will be a new World Cup champion crowned Sunday.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nBefore Wednesday, it was possible to imagine a version of the World Cup where the U.S., even without its most decorated and talented players, still won gold. Maybe Walker and Turner wouldn\u2019t have their worst games at the worst time; maybe Jayson Tatum wouldn\u2019t miss the last four games with a sprained ankle, and maybe the Americans wouldn\u2019t go 7-of-20 from deep and 14-of-21 from the line in a knockout game. It didn\u2019t shake out that way, though, so now USA Basketball has to figure out what\u2019s next.\n\nThe U.S. has already secured a spot in the 2020 Summer Olympics, the tournament that always draws a brighter brand of U.S. star than the off-year World Cup. There\u2019s a good chance that by this time next year we\u2019ll be discussing the performance of a roster featuring multiple MVPs rather than one featuring a single All-NBA performer. And perhaps that\u2019s what matters most\u2014getting USA\u2019s A-team, or at least something close to it, rather than fretting too much about how the pieces all fit together.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering, though, that the last three Olympic teams featuring those All-Star names still had to sweat against international opponents with lesser NBA-caliber talent, but much more cohesive rosters. This result isn\u2019t just about the best and brightest feeling stirred enough to commit to turning out next summer; it\u2019s about those who do then devoting themselves to the pursuit enough to develop the familiarity to produce a more consistent offense and better defense against the pick-and-roll and off-ball cuts. If that doesn\u2019t happen, a loss like this can happen again, on the grandest stage in the international game. The fear is gone, there\u2019s blood in the water, and now it\u2019s time to react. For 16 years, it\u2019s been considered a given that Team USA is exceptional. This loss shows that it isn\u2019t, and won\u2019t be, if those involved don\u2019t treat it as such.","similarity":0.9923333526},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/4\/26\/18517507\/nba-playoffs-most-boring-first-round","id":18281548,"title":"Is This the Most Boring First Round in NBA History? - The Ringer","description":"So much for those upsets.

Damian Lillard waved goodbye to the Thunder, Jared Dudley brawled with the entire city of Philadelphia, and the Warriors suffered a schadenfreude-laden second-half collapse in Game 2 against the Clippers. \n\nBut on the whole, this first round has been rather tame and noncompetitive. Two series were sweeps and another four were gentleman\u2019s sweeps (when the losing team wins just one game). The East\u2019s four favorites went 16-2. Even the expected upset in the West went sideways, as Lillard\u2019s Trail Blazers tore through the Thunder in just five games. That\u2019s pretty boring! But is it the most boring first round in NBA history? We can try to answer that query a few different ways.\n\nLet\u2019s start simple, by looking at how long the different series lasted. The first-round format changed from best-of-five to best-of-seven in 2003. Here are the combined games won by the eight series losers each year since then. (This chart assumes\u2014like the Rockets\u2014that Golden State will finish off the Clippers in Friday\u2019s Game 6. If that series goes seven\u2014which, wow\u2014add one more game to 2019\u2019s total.)\n\nSo 2019 isn\u2019t at a historical ebb in this regard, but it comes close. It\u2019s rare for so few series to last more than five games; Nuggets\u2013Spurs, which heads to a Game 7 this weekend after San Antonio\u2019s resounding win Thursday, is a saving grace for the entire 2019 first round. And even that series hasn\u2019t entertained all that much on a game-by-game level, with the last four games in the series being decided by double-digits.\n\nThat\u2019s the second broad method  to compare 2019\u2019s first round with previous ones, and once again, this postseason falls relatively flat. Thanks to a lack of close games and an overabundance of blowouts, the average game in this year\u2019s first round has been decided by 13.9 points. That\u2019s the second-highest mark since 1984 (the first year of the 16-team playoff format), behind only 2016\u2019s 14.7-point average margin. \n\nNo 2019 playoff game has gone to overtime, and just three of 39 (8 percent) have been decided by a single possession. That\u2019s a remarkably low rate; it hasn\u2019t been below 10 percent since 2007. From 1984 to 2018, 21 percent of first-round games were either overtime contests or decided by three points or fewer, so even doubling the amount of exciting end-of-game situations in this year\u2019s first round would have left it short of the expectation.\n\nOn the other end, 11 of 39 games (28 percent) have been decided by 20-plus points. That\u2019s the second-highest ratio of extreme blowouts of any first round to date, and it doubles the pre-2019 rate of 14 percent.\n\nThe greatest culprit here is the Bucks, who dismantled the Pistons in historic fashion. The closest contest in that mismatched 1 vs. 8 series was Milwaukee\u2019s 16-point win in Game 3; overall, the Bucks won by an average 24-point margin. Of the nearly 300 first-round series winners since 1984, that\u2019s the fourth-largest differential\u2014one spot ahead of the 1996 Bulls. \n\nMilwaukee\u2019s 1-over-8 romp set the pattern for the entire round, whereby higher seeds have outplayed their upset-hungry opponents. On the opening afternoon of the 2019 postseason, both Brooklyn and Orlando notched surprising road wins to take 1-0 leads, and the playoffs looked like they could be chaotic. Then their respective opponents\u2014Philadelphia and Toronto\u2014recovered to win four straight games each, and those upstarts\u2019 upset plans shattered.\n\nAll six completed series to date have gone the higher seeds\u2019 way. The remaining two series lean that way, too: Denver will host San Antonio, and home teams have historically won about 80 percent of Game 7s; top-seeded Golden State, meanwhile, leads the Clippers 3-2 and can be expected to complete its series victory, recent lackadaisical play be darned. (Though if Golden State loses another 3-1 lead, specifically to this opponent in this fashion, that result would single-handedly make the 2019 first round one of the more memorable in history.) If both Denver and Golden State win, this year will mark the first since 2008 with no upsets. For context, that was the same year that Steph Curry burst onto the national stage with a stirring NCAA tournament run at Davidson.\n\nThe bad news is that all these analyses confirm the historical mundanity of the 2019 first round, but the good news is that the past two weeks of boredom, if anything, portend more entertaining series to come. The sample is small, but since 2003, there is a negative-0.34 correlation (on a scale where 0 means no relationship and negative-1 a perfectly inverse relationship) between games in a given postseason\u2019s first round and games in its second round. In other words, more games in the first round tend to lead to fewer games in the second round, and vice versa\u2014so if that pattern holds this season, relatively bored NBA fans should be in store for far more entertainment in the coming round.\n\nThat relationship bares out in a subjective glimpse at this year\u2019s second-round matchups. Ever since the Pacers lost Victor Oladipo for the season, the Eastern Conference has looked like a four-team race, and now that fiercer level of competition begins. In the West, meanwhile, the first round had more games and story lines than the East but still not as much drama as might be expected from such a deep conference. Enter (most likely) a conference finals rematch between the Warriors and Rockets, only one round earlier.\n\nThis relationship is a bit like March Madness, where some fans find a clash between cheering for early-round upsets and hoping for top-notch play in the Final Four. That the Raptors and Sixers survived early scares in the first round might have disappointed neutral observers, but now those two teams meet for a titanic clash swirling with story lines. The first round has been boring overall; that fact is hard to dispute, barring a Golden State collapse this weekend. But it should yield even more excitement now.\n\n\n\n","similarity":0.992259264},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/6\/4\/18651504\/toronto-raptors-statisical-models-nba-finals","id":18415545,"title":"What the Computers Knew About the Toronto Raptors - The Ringer","description":"Many statistical models liked Toronto\u2019s chances in the 2019 NBA Finals more than the public.

In The Ringer\u2019s NBA Finals preview, every writer picked the Warriors to win, and nobody thought the series would last seven games. The same was true at Sports Illustrated. It was almost true at ESPN, where 19 of 21 writers picked Golden State. And the gamblers in Las Vegas favored Golden State by a considerable amount, picking the Warriors at a nearly 3-to-1 clip.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nSo nobody believed in the Raptors. Or, no group of people did, anyway. The computers were comparatively enamored of Toronto\u2019s chances. FiveThirtyEight favored Toronto. ESPN\u2019s Basketball Power Index calculated the split at Golden State, 52 percent; Toronto, 48. Basketball-Reference\u2019s formula spit out a result in the same range. A University of Toronto statistics professor\u2019s model gave Toronto a slight edge. Yet even then, few believed the numbers. In a published staff chat, FiveThirtyEight writer Chris Herring wrote, \u201cOur model is wrong. All due respect to our model.\u201d\n\nBut after Toronto more than held its own through two games of the Finals, split two games at home, and nearly took a 2-0 series lead, those computers look more prescient than they did a week ago\u2014or at least more prescient than all the people who doubted them. (Like myself, who picked the Warriors in five. Mea culpa.) Golden State still may win the series\u2014and is in fact now favored in all those models\u2014but Toronto still looks like a far more formidable opponent, with a legitimate chance to win and a strong chance to keep the series even. What did the computers see that the public missed? A few factors come to mind.\n\nThe simplest way to predict a playoff series is to pick the better team, and the simplest way to identify the better team is to look at the two competitors\u2019 regular-season results. Eighty-two games is a reasonably large sample, so the superior team during that span is usually better overall, and thus more likely to emerge victorious from a playoff clash.\n\nThat heuristic is a bit less useful in this series because the two teams ended up with nearly identical regular-season results. Toronto finished with a 58-24 record, one win ahead of Golden State, while the Warriors posted a better point differential by just 0.4 net points per game. The point here, however, isn\u2019t to pick at those small differences to try to identify the better team, but rather to acknowledge that those numbers are darn close. We should have expected this series to be close, too.\n\nRunning a Log5 calculation\u2014a method invented by Bill James to estimate the probability of each team winning a game\u2014with the two teams\u2019 regular-season records shows that the Raptors would have a 51 percent chance of winning a game against the Warriors on a neutral court. Using their point differential during the course of the season (a more powerful predictive measure than overall record), that probability would be 49 percent. So either way, the result denotes a toss-up. \n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nExamining regular-season results is admittedly tricky for teams like the Warriors, who can coast for long stretches in the winter while retaining an extra gear for when the games truly count. But Toronto evinced signs of reaching a higher level in the playoffs, too. Kawhi Leonard, for instance, missed 22 regular-season games as Toronto carefully managed his workload as he worked his way back from an injured quad. The Raptors were admittedly excellent in those games\u201417-5 with a plus-11.8 point differential, versus a plus-4.0 differential in games he played\u2014but would obviously fare better in the postseason with their star playing more minutes every game. Kyle Lowry, an All-Star this season, missed 17 regular-season games of his own. \n\nThe Raptors also added Marc Gasol at the trade deadline to boost their best lineup\u2019s ceiling, while Golden State\u2019s only in-season acquisition was Andrew Bogut, fresh off winning Australian league MVP honors for the Sydney Kings. Historically, championship teams haven\u2019t needed midseason trades to bolster their roster, but Gasol proved an upgrade over Jonas Valanciunas, even before the playoffs began (plus-15.3 net rating with him on the court).\n\nIt might be easy to mentally discount this factor because Golden State is such an accomplished road team. After their Game 2 victory, the Warriors have now won at least one game away from home in all 23 playoff series since 2013, and they were the league\u2019s best road team in the regular season.\n\nBut because Toronto beat Golden State twice in the regular season, thus besting the Warriors by a single game overall, the Raptors will host a potential Game 7\u2014and that fact does matter. Mathematically, two teams as evenly matched as Toronto and Golden State would project to reach a seventh game about one-third of the time. And since the introduction of the shot clock in 1954-55, home teams have won 79 percent of Game 7s regardless of the round; for the Finals specifically, that rate is a healthy 75 percent (12-4). Through this lens, Golden State\u2019s loss to Cleveland at home in 2016 was an anomaly; before that, every Finals Game 7 since the 1970s had gone the home team\u2019s way.\n\nIf the series goes seven, Toronto would benefit. A Log5 calculation that factors in home\/road point differential splits shows that Toronto would have a 55 percent chance to win a home game against Golden State, versus just a 43 percent chance to win a road game. That difference could be enough to swing the series.\n\nAfter Kevin Durant left Game 5 of Golden State\u2019s second-round series against Houston with an injured calf, the Warriors blitzed through the rest of their Western Conference slate. They won that game against Houston and finished off the Rockets on the road in Game 6; they steamrolled Portland in a sweep while completing several double-digit comebacks along the way. Meanwhile, Toronto needed a miraculous Leonard buzzer-beater to beat Philadelphia in seven games and then fell behind 2-0 against Milwaukee in the conference finals before switching the momentum.\n\nBut that description exaggerates the disparity between the two finalists\u2019 paths. The Warriors struggled in the first round against an overmatched Clippers squad, remember, and while Houston proved as competitive as expected, Portland profiled as a relatively weak conference finals opponent. In the other conference, Milwaukee looked like a dominant force before spiraling against Toronto: The Bucks won 60 games in the regular season (with the point differential of a 64-win team), routed the Pistons in historically lopsided fashion in the first round, and easily handled a talented Celtics roster in the second. Beating Portland in a sweep may seem impressive, but statistically, it isn\u2019t much more of a feat than beating Milwaukee at all. Toronto deserves ample credit\u2014and computer models gave them that due\u2014for navigating its tricky trail to the Finals.\n\nTo reach the championship round, Golden State went 12-4 against the Clippers, Rockets, and Trail Blazers; Toronto went 12-6 against the Magic, 76ers, and Bucks. The public might have leaned Golden State\u2019s way because of the dominance that team showed in the back half of its games against the West, but Toronto\u2019s struggles against high-quality competition should have been viewed as a fantastic achievement rather than a demerit.\n\nOh yeah, the two-time-defending Finals MVP was questionable to play before the series began, and has in fact missed the first two games. That makes a difference, because for all the pre-series chatter about Golden State\u2019s more entertaining playing style without Durant, the team is certainly worse without him.\n\nSome models don\u2019t account for injuries and midseason transactions and instead just look at past team success, but for those that do, Durant\u2019s uncertain health proved the final factor that balanced the two teams\u2019 odds. FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver wrote that Golden State would have been roughly a 2-to-1 favorite by FiveThirtyEight\u2019s calculation if both teams were fully healthy\u2014a ratio more in line with the public perception.\n\nFiveThirtyEight\u2019s model uses dynamic health estimates, which means it accounted for the fact that Durant would be more likely to play games later in the series. That reason helps explain why that site thinks the Warriors are now 62 percent favorites to win the Finals, although Klay Thompson\u2019s injury may further change the calculus. But 62 percent is still closer to a toss-up than a sure thing; it means the Raptors have a 38 percent chance, or the same chance that Leonard has of making any given 3-pointer.\n\nThe Raptors definitely still have an opportunity, even after letting Game 2 slip away. If anything, the first two games demonstrated that they have a better opportunity than many people thought. If only we had listened to the computers, or sought to see what they saw.","similarity":0.9921889901},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2020\/9\/3\/21419794\/chris-paul-oklahoma-city-thunder-game-7-loss","id":21183835,"title":"The Basketball Gods Have Punished Chris Paul Once Again - The Ringer","description":"The Thunder star\u2019s insistence on trying to win by technicality cost him Game 7.

But there was something fitting about Chris Paul furiously lobbying the officials in the decisive moments only to come up short in the end. \n\nOklahoma City couldn\u2019t inbound the ball down two with 1.1 seconds left. Billy Donovan called a timeout to avoid a five-second violation, but Paul drew an off-ball foul on James Harden at the same time. The referees were going to honor Donovan\u2019s timeout call before Paul convinced Scott Foster, whom he has a long and tangled history with, as he discussed after the game, that the foul came first. Because it was off the ball in the final two minutes, the Thunder got one free throw and the ball again. But Danilo Gallinari missed the freebie and the Rockets broke up the ensuing inbound pass and time expired.\n\nBubble Blog: Your NBA Playoff Tracker\n\nThe need-to-know outcomes, analysis, and esoterica from Orlando\n\n\n\nPaul\u2019s performance down the stretch of Game 7, including a costly turnover against Eric Gordon and passing up a chance to take a final shot with 15 seconds left, was made worse by the way he trolled Harden after winning Game 6: \u201cWhen it gets to clutch time, fourth quarter, some people are built for it, some people shy away from it.\u201d\n\nHe was coming off one of the best clutch regular seasons of all time, but he has never been known for late-game heroics in the playoffs. The final seconds of Game 7 felt like divine retribution from the basketball gods. There was no reason to call a cheap foul on Harden on an inbound pass, and there would have been no justice in the Thunder winning the series on it.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nSoccer fans call what Paul did in that situation \u201cshithousery.\u201d It\u2019s a broad term that encompasses players who bend the rules as relentlessly as possible to create even the tiniest advantage, from cheap shots to working the refs. Paul has mastered that dark art as well as anyone who has ever played. \n\nIt was on full display in the Thunder\u2019s first-round series. Facing Harden, another future first-ballot Hall of Famer who spends as much time manipulating the refs as playing basketball, only made it worse. Just look at this harebrained sequence with one minute left when both tried to draw offensive fouls:\n\nMost refs don\u2019t like calling fouls in crunch time because they don\u2019t want their decisions to decide the outcome. Harden and Paul play in a way that leaves the refs no choice but to influence the game.\n\nThe final seconds in regulation of Game 3 were even more egregious. The Rockets were inbounding the ball up one with 24 seconds left when Paul tried to draw an offensive foul on Harden only for Harden to return the favor and draw a defensive foul on him. The two ended up falling to the floor at the same time as if they were in the WWE instead of the NBA:\n\nHarden and Paul are both incredibly crafty. Fans would say their style of play is just a reflection of their competitiveness and desire to win. But that argument has never sat right with me. Basketball is a game meant to entertain people. And there\u2019s nothing entertaining about watching refs spend huge chunks of time in the fourth quarter at the replay monitor and ultimately decide the game. \n\nLike in any other sport, there are unwritten rules in basketball. Everyone has to agree to a certain standard of behavior to create an entertaining product. The refs cannot blow the whistle every time down the floor. That doesn\u2019t mean players should be tackling each other to win games. \n\nWhat separates Paul from players like Harden is that he flops while also playing borderline recklessly on defense. He toes the line on most possessions, grabbing and holding opponents and daring the refs to make a call. You cannot be a player who clears space with nut shots while also wildly exaggerating contact whenever you are hit. \n\nHis antics can be somewhat endearing at times, like earlier this season when he snitched on Jordan Bell for an untucked jersey, initiating a chain of events that led to an unlikely Thunder victory. \n\nBut there are also shameless and mean-spirited instances. In this sequence from an otherwise meaningless game nearly a decade ago, Paul flops in an effort to draw a technical foul on DeMarcus Cousins:\n\nThis is what Cousins said about Paul: \u201cSome players I don\u2019t respect. Just their playing style of basketball. I don\u2019t respect it. I feel like it\u2019s basically cheating and I don\u2019t respect a cheater. If that\u2019s your tactic to winning, I don\u2019t respect you.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not like Paul needs to do this stuff. He\u2019s a fantastic player who single-handedly revived the Thunder at age 35, and averaged 21.3 points on 49.1 percent shooting, 7.4 rebounds, and 5.3 assists per game in the series. \n\nHe has also drawn raves for his leadership as president of the players\u2019 union in the midst of unprecedented crisis and turmoil. But even that role has come with controversy. Some around the league believe that Paul took the job partly to change a rule in the CBA that prevented players his age from signing a supermax extension.  \n\nHe just seems to always end up coloring outside the lines. Maybe Paul should be celebrated for doing whatever it takes to win \u2026 but he doesn\u2019t actually win all that much. \n\nPaul, who has a career 7-10 record in playoff series when he\u2019s been healthy, is also famous for his postseason collapses. One of his worst came when he was playing against the Thunder in 2014. It was Game 5 in a second-round series tied 2-2. The Clippers had the ball up two with 17 seconds left. Paul tried to draw a shooting foul in the backcourt instead of just accepting the foul. The result was a turnover that allowed the Thunder to tie the game and ultimately win the series:\n\nOne of the smartest players in the NBA got his own team eliminated by trying to do too much. That\u2019s the story of Paul\u2019s career in a nutshell. Live by shithousery and you will die by it, too.

The 2005-06 Clippers \u2014 featuring a dominant Elton Brand; Sam Cassell\u2019s large, aging testicles; an older Cuttino Mobley; a younger Chris Kaman; and a prime Corey Maggette shaking off a nagging foot injury\u2014won a respectable 47 games, the most since the franchise was known as the Buffalo Braves. That team not only won me over, it was by far the most beloved team in franchise history \u2026 until this season.\n\nThe 2018-19 Clippers were not supposed to go 48-34. They traded away franchise savior Blake Griffin before the 2018 deadline and lost longtime defensive anchor DeAndre Jordan in free agency, marking the end of the Lob City era. With zero remaining players from the most successful stretch in franchise history, the season was forecasted to be a step backward, as reflected in the preseason win total betting line of 35.5. To make matters worse, the next-door-neighbor Lakers landed LeBron James in free agency and looked to restore their rich tradition. The Clips, on the other hand, seemed well on their way to reassuming their position as the forgotten little brother of Los Angeles basketball.\n\nInstead, the Clippers defied expectations at every turn, playing with a resiliency that shocked opponents and fans alike. They held first place in the formidable Western Conference for a week or so in November and continued to bulldoze over conventional suppositions after trading leading scorer and rebounder Tobias Harris, going 18-9 the rest of the way and rolling to an improbable playoff berth.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nAs predictions shattered left and right, these Clippers supplanted the 2005-06 team as the most beloved team in franchise history. The grit of this team resonates with the Clippers fan base\u2014a fan base that is, at least in my experience, mostly blue-collar locals who took to the team either because they feel at odds with the glitz and glamor of the Lakers or because they could actually afford a seat at a Clippers game. The fact that they won 11 more games than LeBron James\u2019s Lakers made it even sweeter.\n\nLakers schadenfreude may fuel Clippers fandom almost as much as a fondness for the Clippers themselves, probably because choosing to become a Clippers fan is as much a rejection of the easy choice. The Lakers, despite their six-year dry spell, are one of the most successful and popular teams in all of sports. So it cannot be overstated how satisfying it is for Clippers fans that their team bested the Lakers in what was supposed to be their return to greatness. The 2005-06 Lakers also languished, relative to their prosperous history, but they had Kobe Bryant at the peak of his post-Shaq, cold-blooded era; Bryant averaged 35.4 points that season, the most since Michael Jordan nearly two decades before. This season\u2019s Lakers had LeBron, the closest player to Kobe\u2019s celebrity in recent history, yet the team not only failed to even make the playoffs, large swaths of Lakers fans outright rejected James as one of their own.\n\nThe Clippers, meanwhile, were not only good, they were good because of a series of prudent decisions rather than a misguided hope in exceptionalism, which has been the guiding force for the Lakers even in their golden years. While the Lakers tried to bully the Pelicans into giving them their best player, the Clippers executed a series of trades that landed them two 22-year-old starters\u2014one from the Lakers in a deadline heist\u2014two quality rotation players, and more draft picks, all without sacrificing future financial flexibility. It was as if the Clippers were showing the Lakers what they should be doing in real time. \n\nThe Clippers\u2019 meticulous approach was also a contrast with how the best teams in franchise history were built. The Lob City era lived off the star power of Griffin, Jordan, and Chris Paul, and to a lesser extent JJ Redick, yet the front office, run for the most part by coach Doc Rivers, could never find a capable fifth starter, let alone a competent bench. So much about the Clippers had changed\u2014Donald Sterling, their longtime repugnant owner, was banned from the NBA amid the team\u2019s first-round victory over the Warriors\u2014yet they were still undone by mismanagement. There were also the grating on-court antics, the constant injuries, and a string of playoff letdowns. In 2017, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Neil Paine found that the Lob City Clippers were statistically the most disappointing team in NBA history. More than the franchise-best win totals, that is their legacy\u2014what could have been.\n\nThe 2018-19 Clippers had no expectations to speak of. There were no \u201cif only Chris and Blake could stay healthy at the same time\u201d or \u201cif only Elton Brand could make the leap\u201d concerns. And when there\u2019s nowhere to go but up, even the smallest victories are more satisfying. Danilo Gallinari and Pat Beverley, two veterans with extensive injury histories, stayed healthy for most of the season. Presumptive Sixth Man of the Year Lou Williams somehow managed to elevate, not decline, at age 32. Montrezl Harrell, who I once called a human torpedo, became more of a human ballistic missile. Draft enigma Shai Gilgeous-Alexander surprised everyone but Jerry West with solid all-around production and earned himself the starting point guard spot. \n\nThe season ended Friday in a first-round exit against the reigning champion Golden State Warriors, though not without a memorable, and historic, 31-point comeback victory at Oracle Arena in Game 2, and another win on the champs\u2019 home floor in Game 5. But unlike several of the teams getting tossed from the playoffs this week, things only figure to get better from here for the Clippers. While the front office has made good on owner Steve Ballmer\u2019s pledge to remain competitive, it\u2019s hardly a secret that all of the moves the Clippers have made of late were done with an eye toward this summer, when Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and a few other franchise-changing players could be available. Landing any player of that caliber would be a dramatic leap forward for the franchise; while the Lob City team featured two of the biggest names in the sport at the time, neither Griffin nor Paul picked the team as a free agent (though both did re-sign). The catch is that signing any one (or two) star would mean losing at least some of the cogs of this season\u2019s team.\n\nOnly six players on this Clippers roster have guaranteed contracts for next year (Gallo, Lou, Trez, SGA, Landry Shamet, and Jerome Robinson). Beverley, the heart of the team, will be an unrestricted free agent and presumably looking to cash in for what could be his final non-minimum deal in the NBA (he\u2019ll turn 31 in July). And if they somehow swing a deal for Anthony Davis or need to open up cap space for a second max contract, it would most likely require them to find a new home for Gallinari\u2019s contract. Even the most ardent Gallo supporters among Clippers fans\u2014myself included\u2014would happily sign off on a deal that meant adding a player of Davis\u2019s caliber, but the calculus, at least among fans, goes beyond cap sheets with a team this beloved. \n\nIf you polled Clippers fans right now, most might say \u201cjust re-sign everybody and have another go at it.\u201d And on the surface, that\u2019s logical; many of the core players other than  Beverley are under contract, and the young players will presumably improve. But trying to re-create the magic of this season may be even more dangerous than trying to cash in some of the pieces for a star. The Clippers\u2019 extraordinary injury luck cannot possibly last for another season, especially as players age another year. Plus, it would be foolish to bank on all the young players developing as predicted; just ask the Celtics.\n\nRemember that beloved 2005-06 team? Well, its direct successor may be a warning sign for this upcoming offseason. In the summer of 2006, the Clips re-signed Cassell and Kaman, replaced Vladimir Radmanovic with Tim Thomas, and banked on Shaun Livingston\u2019s development. But Cassell, at age 37, predictably declined and sat out much of the season with injuries. Then Livingston went down with a horrific leg injury that derailed his career. The Clippers went 40-42 and were edged out of the playoff field by the \u201cWe Believe\u201d Warriors. In the following years, the Clippers slipped back into the doldrums until they won the Blake Griffin lottery in 2009\u2014and even then, they had to wait an extra year because of a left knee injury in Griffin\u2019s preseason debut.\n\nIf that sounds overly cynical, then you must be new to the Clippers. The franchise\u2019s history of futility runs deep, and even though they\u2019ve been more successful of late\u2014the Clippers have as many playoff berths over the past eight years (seven) as they did in the previous 40\u2014it has hardly been a pax romana. Still, if the rumors are true, the Clips will at least add Leonard to their strong young core and continue their steady ascent in the Western Conference. We\u2019ll see. My only hope is that this Clippers team is a prelude of bigger things to come, rather than just another faint glimmer of hope before everything falls apart. \n\nThis season was special. I hope it stays that way.","similarity":0.9912180305},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/9\/12\/20861645\/team-usa-next-generation-zion-williamson-world-cup","id":20625686,"title":"It\u2019s Time for the Next Generation of Team USA to Step Up   - The Ringer","description":"Zion Williamson and the best U.S.-born up-and-comers need to take the reins of USA Basketball to avoid another ugly international defeat","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/3NDq93hZAtjLvzTp0wMtNGNRa7Q=\/0x248:3000x1819\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19191288\/team_usa_future.jpg","tags":"Front Page,NBA,Sports","groups":["NBA","Sports"],"author":"Jonathan Tjarks","date":"2019-09-12T06:10:00-04:00","content":"There was one clear lesson from Team USA\u2019s 89-79 loss to France at the FIBA World Cup on Wednesday: They didn\u2019t have enough talent. The Americans were ravaged by withdrawals and injuries, forcing them to rely on a group of flawed players whose weaknesses were exploited by a well-coached French team with an NBA-caliber player at every position.\n\nThe best U.S. players have always preferred playing in the Olympics over the World Cup. That didn\u2019t matter at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups (then known as the World Championship) because Team USA used those tournaments to prepare the next generation of great players. The problem this time around was that many of the best young Americans weren\u2019t in China, either because they chose to stay at home or they weren\u2019t quite ready to play on the international stage. The difference in 25-and-under talent in 2019 compared to 2014 and 2010 is striking:\n\nMitchell did his part. He had 29 points, six rebounds, and four assists against France, and was Team USA\u2019s best all-around player. But Tatum played only two games before spraining his ankle, and neither Turner nor Brown did enough to establish themselves as mainstays going forward. \n\nThe future of the program is in flux. The players from the 2010 team have stopped competing internationally, and there may not be any left from the 2014 team, either. Harden, Davis, and Irving have already won Olympic gold, while Thompson just tore his ACL and Cousins has suffered too many injuries to list. There could be plenty of spots available on Team USA for players in the next generation. \n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nInternational basketball has changed since the days of the Redeem Team. Giannis Antetokounmpo could be the best player in the world for the next decade, while many of the best young prospects in the NBA, from Luka Doncic to Kristaps Porzingis and Karl-Anthony Towns, don\u2019t play for the U.S. The Americans have to focus more on finding players who complement each other instead of just gathering as much talent as possible and seeing what sticks. \n\nThe good news is the outline of the next version of Team USA is already coming into focus. There are four young players who stand out as potential cornerstones, all of whom fit well together:\n\nYoung is coming off a brilliant rookie season with the Hawks, when he averaged 19.1 points on 41.8 percent shooting and 8.1 assists per game. He played for the U.S. Select Team this summer and had an outside chance of making the World Cup roster before withdrawing with an eye infection. His combination of unlimited shooting range and elite playmaking makes him a perfect fit for Team USA. The Americans don\u2019t need a big-time scorer at point; they need someone who can create easy shots for teammates in transition and shoot defenses out of zones in the half court. And while Young will have issues on defense, the Americans should have more than enough long and athletic perimeter players to protect him, from returning players like Mitchell and Tatum to a Select Team player like Jonathan Isaac.\n\nBooker is one of the more polarizing players in the NBA, but there\u2019s no denying his growth in his first four seasons. He went from a shooting specialist in college to an elite scorer (26.6 points per game on 46.7 percent shooting last season) who stretches out the defense (6.5 3-point attempts per game) and makes plays for his teammates (6.8 assists per game). A backcourt of Young and Booker would open up the floor and prevent defenses from playing zone. Booker\u2019s individual stats have benefited from receiving the Suns\u2019 constant green light, but he would have a better reputation around the league if he were playing for a well-run organization. He fits the profile of a young star on a bad team who could get a wandering eye after his time on Team USA. \n\nWilliamson, despite being a teenager with no NBA experience, could have been a difference-maker in China. At 6-foot-7 and 285 pounds, his combination of size, speed, and athleticism would have posed matchup problems for most of the teams in the field. At the very least, he would have been a better fit than Harrison Barnes as a small-ball 5. Williamson isn\u2019t just an athlete\u2014he\u2019s a skilled player with a high basketball IQ who knows how to maximize his physical gifts. His ability to pass out of the high post would have been huge for a team that struggled to make plays against zone defenses. Williamson is one of the most exciting prospects to enter the league in a long time. There is no telling how good he will be by the time the next World Cup rolls around in 2023.\n\nJackson is the next great American unicorn after Davis. Team USA will need a 7-footer with his type of length and athleticism to match up with guys like Giannis, Nikola Jokic, Towns, and Porzingis in future international tournaments. Jackson was the best rookie big man of the five taken in the top seven in the 2018 draft, and he should be even better in Year 2. Everyone knows about his ability to shoot 3s, protect the rim, and defend on the perimeter. Now, after serving as an understudy to Marc Gasol and Mike Conley Jr., Jackson will get the chance to show that he can also put the ball on the floor and create his own shot. He can do almost everything on a basketball court at a high level, and his versatility on both sides of the ball would add an element that the latest version of Team USA was sorely lacking.\n\nThat may not be the most awe-inspiring list in comparison with the Redeem Team generation, but this foursome\u2019s style of play is a better fit for the international game. The best defensive strategy against the Americans has always been to pack the paint to neutralize their athleticism and turn them into shooters. The best scorers in the next generation are all volume 3-point shooters, which means the U.S. won\u2019t have to rely on shooting specialists like Joe Harris and Brook Lopez to be zone-busters anymore. \n\nPlayers like Young, Booker, and Jackson grew up watching Steph Curry. Shooting 3s from all over the floor is second nature to them. That shooting ability, in turn, will create massive openings at the rim for players like Williamson. Team USA always brings the best athletes to international competitions. Now we will have the best shooters, too.

Measures like a significantly stiffer luxury tax, with brutal financial penalties for repeat offenders, seemed targeted at high-revenue\/big-market franchises hell-bent on flouting the league\u2019s soft cap to hoard high-priced players. The introduction of the designated veteran player extension, more commonly referred to as the \u201csupermax,\u201d aimed to give lower-revenue\/smaller-market teams a powerful weapon in the fight to keep their homegrown stars\u2014the ability to pay significantly more money than any other team could.\n\nThe Board of Governors might not be batting 1.000 on those changes\u2014the new tax structure seems to have worked out as intended; the supermax, maybe not so much\u2014but the direction is clear. As NBA commissioner Adam Silver said before the 2018 NBA Finals, \u201cThe notion in this league is parity of opportunity.\u201d The Raptors\u2019 title win, to some, represented a victory for that notion. And with the Warriors wounded and wobbling, so much money up for grabs in free agency, and so many teams seemingly within one move and some good luck of making a Finals run, it seemed like we might be about to say goodnight to the superteam era for good.\n\nThat talk might have been premature, though. Whether they galaxy-brained the NBA-watching world into confusing a carefully concocted plan for a mind-blowing mistake, or just found an 11th-hour way to unwind an egregious error, the Los Angeles Lakers are where they wanted to be: with two superstars in the fold, and the means to acquire a third. LeBron James came last summer. Anthony Davis, after a brief half-season layover, arrived two weeks ago. And with Thursday\u2019s news that L.A. has expanded its deal with the Pelicans into a three-teamer that will ship Mo Wagner, Isaac Bonga, Jemerrio Jones, and a 2022 second-round pick to the Wizards, the Lakers can now open up $32 million in salary cap space to spend when free agency opens up on Sunday. That sound you are hearing is the theme from Jaws.\n\nThe adjusted deal structure still leaves the Lakers about $700,000 shy of what a player with between seven and nine years of service time can earn in the first season of a maximum-salaried contract if the salary cap remains at the projected $109 million. But in a world in which Davis just waved a $4 million trade kicker to facilitate the move to his preferred destination, $700,000 is probably closer to a rounding error than an impediment to landing a top-tier superstar who wants to link up in L.A. According to ESPN\u2019s Stephen A. Smith, perhaps the best player on the free-agent market just might. \n\nStephen A. Smith - \u201cI have received word that Kawhi Leonard is seriously considering the Los Angeles Lakers.\u201d pic.twitter.com\/mfsd6locjD\n\nIt\u2019s no shock that the Lakers want to pursue Kawhi Leonard. Rob Pelinka and Co. have reportedly held firm to the belief that the Lakers would be in the mix for the two-time Finals MVP despite the widespread public perception that the race for his services had only two serious entrants: the Raptors, whom he just led to the NBA championship, and the Clippers, who have lusted after Leonard all season. That seemed unlikely when it appeared the Lakers would be able to open up only somewhere between $23 million and $28 million in cap space following the Davis deal. But things shifted as soon as the AD deal\u2019s structure changed Thursday; all of a sudden, Leonard planned to grant the Lakers a meeting.\n\nThe Clippers and Raptors will get to make their cases, too, with Toronto reportedly scheduled to have the last word. The Raptors just proved to Leonard that they could keep him healthy after he\u2019d missed nearly an entire season with a quadriceps injury, and that they could put a championship-caliber team around him. The Clippers have built a deep, promising, young roster with the flexibility to add multiple pieces around Leonard, and have developed a reputation as one of the league\u2019s savviest and smartest front offices under the aegis of deep-pocketed and passionate owner Steve Ballmer.\n\nIn Toronto, Kawhi will remain a folk hero, the King in the North, the man who gave an increasingly basketball-rabid nation its first NBA championship. With the Clippers, Leonard can elevate another organization to unprecedented prominence and become the greatest player in the history of another franchise, this time closer to the comforts of his Southern California home. Maybe those pitches will resonate; maybe it would appeal to Leonard to have everything revolve entirely around him.\n\nThen again, maybe it wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to lie: My first reaction to the idea of Leonard donning purple and gold was that being the third man into a Big Three doesn\u2019t really sound like Kawhi. But I have no idea what actually animates Leonard, and I\u2019m not sure anyone else does, either. Maybe a player who has already won two NBA championships and two Finals MVP trophies\u2014who has already carried a franchise to new heights on his broad shoulders, who has already had to create damn near everything against elite defenses on his own in the hothouse of a postseason series\u2014will prefer the idea of being flanked by two other world-breakers for a change.\n\nKawhi had to ostensibly be LeBron to win his second ring. Maybe he\u2019d rather try to win a third with the help of the original and a 26-year-old All-NBA big man who joins Leonard and Giannis Antetokounmpo on an extremely short list of players with the two-way talent to win MVP and Defensive Player of the Year in the same season. That might sound a hell of a lot more appealing than spending entire playoff quarters wondering whether anyone else is going to shoot.\n\nA LeBron-AD-Kawhi Lakers team would still have work to do, of course. The only other pieces on the roster at present are bucket-getting mainstay Kyle Kuzma and second-round rookie Talen Horton-Tucker. That team features zero guards\u2014well, LeBron\u2019s essentially the point guard, but you know what I mean\u2014and will have only the $4.8 million room midlevel exception and minimum salary exceptions with which to field a full NBA roster. Maybe a bunch of quality veterans will be willing to take a lot less money to roll with the winners. But with so many teams in possession of so much money to spend, maybe they won\u2019t; Pelinka could have a hard time giving new coach Frank Vogel a full complement of NBA-caliber sidemen to surround his new power trio. This is the argument for taking that $32 million in cap space and trying to spend it on four or five useful role players; it\u2019s awfully hard to win a title with like nine dudes playing for the minimum, even if your top three are historic. (Especially when all three of them will probably require minutes-and-games-restricting load management plans, or at least would likely benefit greatly from them.)\n\nIf Leonard wants to come, though, you throw all of that out the window, and pay perhaps the best player in the world to come play with your team. Let Silver, the Board of Governors, and us blog boys rend our garments about what it means when the player who turned the Raptors into the reason to believe you don\u2019t need to stack superstars to win anymore decides to up and join a new superstar stack. Put all that talk about the end of the superteam era to bed and go about the business of making the next era your era; put the talent together and force the rest of the NBA to get its weight up. The notion in this league is parity of opportunity. This is the Lakers\u2019 chance to seize theirs.","similarity":0.9909197092},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/5\/8\/18537224\/klay-thompson-unhappy-warriors-golden-state-playoffs","id":18301265,"title":"So \u2026 What\u2019s Going on With Klay Thompson? - The Ringer","description":"The Warriors star has had his share of struggles against the Rockets, and a report suggests he\u2019s no longer happy in Golden State.

In good times, stressful times, and bad times, Klay has simply remained Klay. It\u2019s the NBA\u2019s own, subtler, version of \u201cManny being Manny.\u201d Sometimes, that means calling out the Oracle Arena fans for not being loud enough. Other times it means wearing a Louis Vuitton vest and shades to a postgame interview, as Klay did after scoring 32 points in Game 4 of the Warriors-Clippers first-round series. That feels like a long time ago. \n\nSince that performance, the Warriors\u2019 exuberance and Thompson\u2019s showmanship has been tamped down by a Rockets team that has more or less been an even match for Golden State. The Warriors seem more vulnerable than ever before, and now even the team\u2019s future is being called into question. On Wednesday, ESPN\u2019s Stephen A. Smith reported that Thompson is unhappy because \u201chis number hasn\u2019t been called enough\u201d in these playoffs, and said that \u201che\u2019s tired of sitting around and getting, this is a quote, the \u2018crumbs\u2019 left behind by other people.\u201d Smith said that this information came from people around Thompson, though he didn\u2019t speak to the Warriors star himself. Not knowing the source, it\u2019s hard to assess how much weight we should give these comments, or whether this will matter when Thompson hits unrestricted free agency this summer. But the timing is notable. \n\nAll season, the prevailing sentiment has been that Thompson plans to stay with the Warriors long-term if they offer him a max contract. His father, Mychal Thompson, has been adamant that Klay wants to be in Golden State; coach Steve Kerr recently said that the organization wants him back; and Andrew Bogut stated that Thompson has never said anything \u201cabout wanting to leave here.\u201d So why is there now a report about him being unhappy? Well, when a team that\u2019s been through four consecutive Finals runs starts to struggle at an earlier stage than it\u2019s used to, fissures, however small, tend to come forward. \n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nThompson is not the face of the franchise like Steph Curry, the polarizing figure like Kevin Durant, or the team\u2019s emotional heartbeat like Draymond Green. This has its benefits. When he shines, he\u2019s the lovable goof who can talk scaffolding and his dog while also taking down an opponent with 10 made 3s. And when he struggles, there\u2019s not much criticism directed his way. Any downturn in his play is seen as a product of the Warriors\u2019 larger issues, and for the most part, that\u2019s true. I wouldn\u2019t demean Thompson\u2019s Hall of Fame\u2013level talents by saying he\u2019s a system player, but it is inarguable that he thrives in the environment the Warriors have built. Thompson is a litmus test for the Warriors\u2019 dominance, and he\u2019s also often the final hammer that finishes off Golden State\u2019s opponents.\n\nThe unique position Thompson holds in the team\u2019s ecosystem has made his performance over the past few games feel disconcerting. Thompson has shot just 38 percent from the field and 30 percent from 3 during the second-round series against the Rockets. In the Warriors\u2019 two losses, Thompson went a combined 3-for-12 from deep. If this were any other player, we\u2019d say that he\u2019s going through a cold streak and move on\u2014we\u2019d likely even shrug it off were this happening to Thompson during the regular season. But the combination of the stage, the matchup, and the way Golden State has looked recently makes Thompson\u2019s performances impossible to ignore. He\u2019s not the reason the Warriors lost twice, but his struggles are a symptom of the team\u2019s inconsistencies and lack of depth, and the way the Rockets have played them. \n\nThompson has had to guard James Harden on the defensive end, which has no doubt been draining. Plus, Klay is still recovering from the ankle injury he suffered in Game 6 of the Clippers series. In the past two games, as Houston has turned this series into a physical, grind-it-out test, those two details have had a larger impact on the way Klay plays. Not to mention Thompson already has played more than 40 minutes in three of the team\u2019s past four games, after he played 40-plus minutes in just five games total during the regular season. It must all be wearing on him, and that could be what\u2019s affecting his shot, too, which could spell trouble for Golden State. \n\nIf you doubt Thompson\u2019s value to the Warriors, or question whether he\u2019s a luxury on a team that already has two transcendent talents, think about this: In the regular season, there were 27 Klay Games (we\u2019ll define that as a game in which Thompson had 25 points or more). Golden State was 21-6 in those contests, good for a .778 winning percentage, which is a better percentage than it posted when either Curry (.750) or Durant (.644) scored 25 points or more. During the postseason, Thompson has scored 25-plus only once. It was a 32-point game in L.A., and look at what we got out of that: \n\nFolks, Klay Thompson: pic.twitter.com\/KEnlFmQF5y\n\nWe are still waiting for a Klay Game in this series, though that feels more like a matter of when, not if, it\u2019ll happen. Perhaps all this talk about his struggles and these rumors will be enough to spur him to one on Wednesday night, in what could technically be the Warriors\u2019 last game in Oracle Arena. (Of course, if Thompson goes off, precedent tells us it probably won\u2019t be.) If Thompson does heat up and the Warriors manage to get back to their winning ways\u2014like they\u2019re expected to all the way to the Finals\u2014it would be nearly impossible to imagine Thompson wearing any other uniform come next season.","similarity":0.9903908372},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/8\/19\/20811547\/team-usa-worst-ever-2019-fiba-world-cup","id":20575588,"title":"Is This the Worst Team USA in Modern History? - The Ringer","description":"The U.S. roster for the 2019 FIBA World Cup is shockingly thin on star power.

Far from it, in fact. NBA players could not play in the 1998 World Championship because of the lockout, so the United States formed a motley roster of professional players outside the NBA and top college players. Jimmy Oliver (career NBA games: 78) and Wendell Alexis (0) led the team in scoring; the U.S. lost games to Lithuania and Russia before winning bronze.\n\nSo things could be worse for Team USA after a summer full of roster declines and dropouts. Barring another bureaucratic boondoggle, though, it\u2019s difficult to imagine how. U.S.-born players who were once in the mix to represent their country at the upcoming tournament but opted out include Marvin Bagley, Bradley Beal, Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, De\u2019Aaron Fox, Eric Gordon, James Harden, Montrezl Harrell, Tobias Harris, Damian Lillard, Kevin Love, Kyle Lowry, CJ McCollum, Paul Millsap, JJ Redick, Julius Randle, P.J. Tucker, and Trae Young. (No, Carmelo Anthony doesn\u2019t count.)\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nThe new Team USA is, evidently, a mix of starters from the 2019-20 Boston Celtics\u2014a team projected to win fewer than 50 games\u2014and other assorted role players from around the league. By almost any statistical measure, they collectively form the least accomplished Team USA roster with actual NBA players. The final roster is still yet to be announced, as Gregg Popovich and his staff must cut the current group of 13 players down to a final 12 before the tournament begins on August 31, but any possible outcome points to the same conclusion.\n\nTo determine where this year\u2019s team stands in history, we set out to assess relative roster strengths across the last few decades of international basketball. We\u2019ll look at two broad measures of individual success: All-Star appearances and win shares. Neither statistic is perfect, but they both work for comparisons across time.\n\nAssuming that Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, and Brook Lopez all make the final roster, players on the 2019 team will have combined for just five All-Star appearances in their careers. Last Olympics, Team USA players had combined for 33 All-Star appearances; even at the World Cup (formerly known as the World Championship), the total is still typically twice as high as the 2019 group\u2019s.\n\nThe same trend appears when looking at only the last season before the tournament, instead of the players\u2019 entire careers: Only two members of 2019 Team USA are coming off All-Star seasons (Walker and Middleton), which ties the low set by the 2004 squad that famously failed to win Olympic gold.\n\nBy win shares, the 2019 roster looks even less qualified to represent the U.S. against the world. Depending on which of the 13 remaining roster candidates is cut, the 12 players who make the team will have combined for about 54 win shares last season. The pre-2019 low (not including 1998) was 80.4, from the 2010 squad that relied on up-and-comers like Kevin Durant instead of the members of 2008\u2019s Olympic Redeem Team. (The 2012 team\u2019s win shares are prorated to 82 games here, as that was the season of the 66-game schedule.)\n\nAnd finally, the same pattern appears again, if not quite as precipitously, when looking at overall win shares at the time each player appeared for Team USA. I\u2019ll spare you the graph because it looks, unsurprisingly, like every other one that\u2019s come thus far.\n\nBut, you may quibble, this team is so young, so maybe they haven\u2019t had the time to collect statistical achievements. Not really\u2014the average age for the 2019 team is 25.7 years (using their listed age on Basketball-Reference for next season), while the overall Team USA average age from 1992 to 2016 (not counting 1998) was 26.7. The rosters in 2004, 2006, 2010, and 2014 were all younger than that in 2019.\n\nAnother potential caveat is that every World Cup\/Championship roster pales in comparison to the Team USA Olympic rosters, so this year\u2019s team was bound to be worse than in 2016. There\u2019s more smoke here; notice the zigzag pattern in the graphs above in every cycle except 2004. Besides that aberration, every Olympics roster has featured more accomplished Americans than the roster before it, and after. Depending on the metric of choice, World Cup\/Championship rosters typically lack somewhere between 20 and 70 percent of the plaudits of their Olympic counterparts. (This chart doesn\u2019t include the 1998 team.)\n\nYet even against that backdrop, the 2019 team is still lacking; all of the previous World Cup\/Championship rosters in the sample looked superior to this one\u2014even in the moment. It\u2019s possible that the 2019 roster could look better in retrospect, if players like Donovan Mitchell and Jayson Tatum develop into perennial All-Stars; the 2014 roster, for instance, included pre-MVP Harden, pre-MVP Steph Curry, pre-champion Klay Thompson, and pre-champion Kyrie Irving. But all of the numbers presented thus far look at the players\u2019 careers before the tournament in question, so even the promise of future improvement doesn\u2019t address the core comparative issue.\n\nIt sounds trite, but the main problem for the present roster is that, lacking the likes of Harden and Lillard, 2019\u2019s Team USA doesn\u2019t boast a single overwhelming star. Walker is the top player based on his performance last season, but he collected only 7.4 win shares, 34th in the NBA. Win shares may lack some important subtleties in their calculation, but Walker is by no means on the level of previous Team USA leading men.\n\nEven the worst editions of Team USA bettered the 2019 group in this area. The much-maligned 2002 roster featured seven players who finished the 2001-02 NBA season with more win shares than Walker had last year. The 2004 Olympic roster had six. And every squad since the Dream Team, 1998 aside, has had at least one player worth 13-plus win shares the previous season. Walker is barely at half of that total.\n\nFinally, this next chart shows every one of the 13 remaining candidates to qualify for the 2019 roster, along with their percentile rankings compared to all Team USA representatives since 1992 (again, with 1998 excepted). In terms of performance in the season before playing for the country, not a single 2019 Team USA player reaches the median level for the overall historical Team USA talent pool. In terms of career performance before playing for the country, only Walker and Lopez reach the median.\n\nEven as the statistical worsts pile up, it\u2019s still conceivable that this lackluster roster could win gold. Popovich is the coach; the guard group in particular could shine, with Walker and Mitchell; the wing collection of Middleton, Harris, Tatum, and Brown supplies an enviable combination of shooting and defensive prowess.\n\nBut based purely on top-end talent, Team USA is not the best, or even second-best, team at this year\u2019s World Cup. Greece, with Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Serbia, with Nikola Jokic, have an NBA MVP and a player who finished fourth in MVP voting, respectively; Team USA doesn\u2019t have a single MVP candidate from last season or next. The Americans haven\u2019t lost a senior-level tournament game since 2006. Now might be their best chance to lose again.","similarity":0.9903818369},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/6\/14\/18679089\/kawhi-leonard-toronto-raptors-playoff-statistics-historical-context","id":18443130,"title":"The 15 Facts That Explain Kawhi Leonard\u2019s All-Time Great Playoff Run - The Ringer","description":"How does the Raptors star\u2019s legendary 2019 postseason stack up in the annals of NBA history?","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/do2rKFykMJ_vejJycRwJQCg4eyY=\/0x0:3000x1571\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/16344542\/kawhi_legacy_getty_ringer.jpg","tags":"Front Page,NBA,2020 NBA Playoffs,NBA Finals,Sports","groups":["NBA Finals","NBA","2020 NBA Playoffs"],"author":"Zach Kram","date":"2019-06-14T12:14:58-04:00","content":"Game 6\u2019s heroics belonged mostly to Toronto\u2019s point guards, Kyle Lowry and Fred VanVleet, but these NBA Finals, like these entire playoffs, belonged to Kawhi Leonard. The first-year Raptors star completed one of the most impressive postseason runs in recent history on Thursday, sealing Toronto\u2019s first title by hitting three free throws in the final second. He scored just 22 points in Game 6, his lowest output of the Finals, but he could be forgiven a somewhat slower night after all that he had already accomplished this spring.\n\nLeonard\u2019s past\u2014which included a 2014 Finals MVP run with the Spurs\u2014first established his playoff bona fides. His present confirmed his status as one of the NBA\u2019s top players. And his future remains a mystery, as Kawhi prepares to enter free agency this summer as perhaps, with Kevin Durant injured, the most sought-after player on the market. Before rampant speculation overtakes the NBA narrative, though, let\u2019s take one final moment to commemorate Leonard\u2019s postseason triumph. The following 15 notes and statistics all point to that same resounding conclusion: Kawhi just delivered a playoff performance for the ages. (Unless otherwise specified, the following facts refer to the 16-playoff-team era, which dates back to 1984, and specifically to players who appeared in at least 10 games during a given postseason.)\n\n1. With his four-bouncer against Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference semifinals\u2014perhaps the league\u2019s most important shot in modern memory, given the assorted ramifications that resulted\u2014Leonard became the first player in NBA history to win a Game 7 with a buzzer-beater. (Michael Jordan won a do-or-die Game 5 with his famous shot over Craig Ehlo.) But you probably knew that already. Let\u2019s move on to the new goodies.\n\n2. Leonard is just the third player in league history to win Finals MVP with multiple teams, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Bucks, Lakers) and LeBron James (Heat, Cavaliers).\n\n3. Of course, Leonard didn\u2019t just lead the Raptors in the Finals. He led them throughout these whole playoffs. Let\u2019s start by looking at the most basic statistic: points. Here is a list of every player since 1984 to average more playoff points per game than Leonard\u2014who finished with 30.5\u2014on a championship team:\n\nThere are two key takeaways here: Leonard had the highest playoff scoring average since 2000. And that Jordan guy was pretty good.\n\n4. Scoring isn\u2019t the only measure of success, though. Let\u2019s turn to game score, a statistic devised by John Hollinger to capture the entirety of a player\u2019s box-score contributions in a single number. Leonard\u2019s 24.2 cumulative game score in these playoffs is mighty impressive. The only champions with a higher average game score than Leonard in 2019 are Larry Bird in 1984 and 1986; Jordan in 1991, 1992, and 1993; Olajuwon in 1995; and O\u2019Neal in 2000. So once again, Leonard is tops since 2000.\n\n5. Among all players with at least 10 playoff games in a season since 1984 (not just the champions), the top eight game scores\u2014and 10 of the top 11\u2014belong to either Jordan or James. Leonard is great; historically so. But he\u2019s not Jordan or James in terms of full-game impact every night.\n\n6. Unlike some other prolific scorers, Leonard achieved his point totals with tremendous efficiency. His 62 percent true shooting mark in these playoffs made him a member of another elite club: players who averaged 30-plus points per game while maintaining a 60-plus true shooting percentage. Besides Leonard, that list in the 16-playoff-team era is just Adrian Dantley in 1984, Bernard King in 1984, Alex English in 1985, Jordan in 1989, O\u2019Neal in 1998, and James in 2009, 2017, and 2018.\n\n7. None of those eight prior seasons ended with a championship, however. Leonard is the first champion to eclipse 30 points per game with 60 percent true shooting.\n\n8. Another all-encompassing statistic is win shares, which divvies up credit for a team\u2019s victories proportional to each player\u2019s contribution. By this measure, Leonard is deemed responsible for 4.9 win shares in these playoffs. That\u2019s the sixth-best mark for any player since 1984, behind only Tim Duncan in 2003, Dirk Nowitzki in 2006, and LeBron in 2012, 2013, and 2018. Players since 2003 have some advantage here: The first round expanded from best-of-five to best-of-seven that year, affording first-round winners an extra victory to divide among their players.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\n9. Leonard inspires more fun facts because he recorded all of these achievements in his first season with the Raptors. Limiting our sample size to just post-1984 removes some notable performances of this ilk, such as Magic Johnson\u2019s rookie postseason with the Lakers in 1980 and Moses Malone\u2019s debut playoffs with the 76ers in 1983. Throughout NBA history, only those two, Kevin Durant in 2017, and Kawhi this year have won Finals MVP in their first season with a team.\n\n10. Since 1984, the statistical company Kawhi keeps among first-season-with-a-team players is astounding. During that time frame, here\u2019s a ranking of the players who tallied the most playoff win shares in their debut campaigns with a franchise heading into 2018-19:\n\nThat list contains a host of legendary playoff runs\u2014and Leonard bested them all with his 4.9\u2013win share total.\n\n11. The more remarkable comparisons, though, come when contemplating how singular this playoff run might look in retrospect, if Leonard leaves Toronto in free agency this summer. That kind of rental-year performance would be truly unprecedented, with no other season coming close. He would, for instance, become the first rental player to win Finals MVP.\n\n12. The previous top playoff rental player by win shares was Tyson Chandler for the 2011 Mavericks (2.7), as he formed a Finals-winning frontcourt tandem with Dirk Nowitzki. The other top options aren\u2019t nearly as memorable as Leonard this year:\n\nIf Leonard leaves in free agency, his 4.9 win shares mean that he was worth as many wins as the other two top rental players in the 16-playoff-team era combined.\n\n13. Here is a list of the top previous rental players from 1984 until now by playoff points per game instead of win shares:\n\nThat Nate Robinson run was outrageous fun. He scored 34 points in a triple-overtime win! And yet, if he qualifies near the top of a leaderboard, it merely demonstrates the weakness of that particular player pool. Leonard exceeded 30 points per game. No other rental player has exceeded 20.\n\n14. If that isn\u2019t enough, Leonard\u2019s cumulative game score in these playoffs was 24.2. Here is every previous rental player who reached a total even half that high:\n\nThat\u2019s it. By game score, Leonard was basically twice as good in the postseason as any other rental player during the 16-playoff-team era.\n\n15. But let\u2019s not think about Leonard\u2019s possibly leaving Toronto just yet, and instead conclude with one longer note about what he has meant to the franchise. He brought the city a title, obviously; he also turned in by far the best set of postseason performances in team history. Seven of the top 14 game scores in Raptors playoff history now belong to Leonard; so do 11 of the top 22. (Vince Carter\u2019s seventh-best playoff game, by comparison, is 73rd on the all-time franchise list. His 11th-best game is in 213th place.) \n\nThe black diamonds on this graph denote all of Leonard\u2019s game scores this postseason. The red circles denote all other game scores in franchise playoff history (among players with at least 30 minutes played). Look how closely concentrated Leonard\u2019s diamonds are to the left, with the exception of one bad outlier game\u2014his 5-of-19 shooting effort in Game 3 of the first round against Orlando. Every other game this spring inspired a solid Leonard performance, or better.\n\nThe most tragic part of this graph is the reverse end of the leaderboard, home to DeMar DeRozan\u2014the main player Toronto traded away in its package deal to acquire Leonard last July. DeRozan enjoyed plenty of excellent playoff games in Toronto\u2014he has 10 of the top 50 games on the graph\u2014but also struggled often under a playoff glare. The worst game on that graph belongs to DeRozan, when he somehow collected a negative-5 game score in one 2016 loss to the Heat. Overall, six of the 13 worst games belong to the man now growing stronger alone. Here\u2019s that graph again, with all of DeRozan\u2019s games highlighted instead of Leonard\u2019s.\n\nLook how much more spread out DeRozan\u2019s playoff games are. He was good and decent and bad. But that\u2019s not a unique slight against DeRozan, who had the misfortune of facing LeBron year after year, while Leonard\u2019s Raptors team could avoid the King entirely. Most players are good and bad and decent\u2014but not Leonard.\n\nSo where does this all leave Leonard\u2019s run, legacy-wise? He won his second Finals MVP, in his first and maybe only season with a new team, by recording one of the five or 10 best playoff runs since the postseason expanded to 16 teams. He scored at the most prolific rate of any champion in nearly 20 years; he had the best combination of scoring rate and efficiency of any champion in the entire data set. If he ends up leaving Toronto this summer, he\u2019ll have set a new standard for rental players; he\u2019ll also be the greatest playoff performer in Raptors franchise history, regardless of what comes next. And he accomplished it all while contending with a talented 76ers team, a historically dominant Bucks team, and a Warriors dynasty that might have started to crumble at Leonard\u2019s hands. This title is Toronto\u2019s; this postseason was Kawhi\u2019s.","similarity":0.9903472066},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/9\/18\/20872568\/steph-curry-olympics-golden-state-warriors","id":20636609,"title":"Steph Curry Is Already Laying the Groundwork for the Year of Steph - The Ringer","description":"By pledging his allegiance to Team USA for next summer\u2019s Olympics, Curry is getting a head start on what\u2019s shaping up to be a big year","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/knPkuiAopAYZSX7Bywy2Ijl7lfo=\/0x0:3000x1571\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19211737\/steph_summer_AP_Ringer.jpg","tags":"Front Page,NBA,Sports","groups":["NBA","Sports"],"author":"Shaker Samman","date":"2019-09-18T14:02:58-04:00","content":"Two weeks remain until NBA players report for training camp, but Stephen Curry is getting a head start on setting his narrative for the 2019-20 season. On Wednesday, the Warriors guard told ESPN\u2019s Rachel Nichols he\u2019s committed to playing in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, becoming the second Warriors superstar to indicate he\u2019ll play for Team USA in as many days following the squad\u2019s disastrous seventh-place finish in the FIBA World Cup this summer. \u201cThat is the plan,\u201d Curry said. \n\nAfter the U.S. faltered in China, team exec Jerry Colangelo had terse words for the players who withdrew from the roster, saying he would \u201cremember\u201d who \u201cdidn\u2019t show up.\u201d In his declaration of intent, Curry made it clear he planned to be around.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been on the Olympic team,\u201d Curry told ESPN. \u201cI\u2019ve been on two World Cup championship gold-medal teams. But the Olympics is the experience that I want. And next year will hopefully be it.\u201d\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nCurry isn\u2019t just announcing his intention, injuries permitting, to play in next summer\u2019s Olympics, though. By taking the lead on rebooting Team USA, he\u2019s climbing atop Narrative Mountain, and announcing loud and clear to the farthest stretches of the NBA: This is going to be the Year of Steph. \n\nThe Warriors enter this season with more uncertainty than they\u2019ve had in years. Draymond Green will turn 30 this season, and struggled at times with injury and fatigue last regular season. Kevin Durant\u2014arguably the best player alive at times last season\u2014departed for Brooklyn, where he\u2019ll begin rehabilitating a ruptured Achilles tendon. Klay Thompson, Steph\u2019s brother in splash, signed a five-year maximum extension with Golden State this offseason, but will miss at least the first half of the season recovering from surgery to repair the ACL in his left knee, which he tore in Game 6 of the Finals. \n\nIn Thompson\u2019s stead is one of last year\u2019s breakout players, All-Star guard D\u2019Angelo Russell, making his full-time return to California after washing out with the Lakers following the 2016-17 season. The former no. 2 pick proved last season that he can contribute offensively, scoring 21.1 points a game, shooting 36.9 percent from beyond the arc, and adding seven assists. How he\u2019ll feature defensively, and integrate into Golden State\u2019s vaunted offensive system, however, is still an open question.\n\nCurry, to an extent, has had to share his spotlight in the Bay Area. The past few years, he\u2019s split the focus with Durant, who joined the Warriors following the 2015-16 season, much to the general public\u2019s chagrin, and seemed to chafe with the notion that the Dubs were Curry\u2019s team. Even when Curry was the league\u2019s most valuable player, he had to divvy up shots with Thompson, whose lights-out shooting, derpy attitude, and occasional flirtation with legendary scoring numbers made him a fan favorite. With the Slim Reaper gone, and Thompson sidelined, the Warriors are Steph\u2019s, and Steph\u2019s alone, for the first time since Monta Ellis shared the locker room. And that should frighten the rest of the league.\n\nThe last time Curry had this commanding a grip on center stage, he led the league in scoring, averaging 30.1 points per night, on 50.4 percent shooting, and a career-high 20.2 attempts. Curry has led the Warriors in shots per game in every season but one since then, and with a supporting cast now headlined by Russell, Green, and a band of misfits, it\u2019s safe to assume his number of shots per game will eclipse 20 once again.\n\nCurry is one of 13 players to own at least two MVP awards; only eight have claimed the prize three times. The runner-up for Curry\u2019s first trophy, James Harden, laid a blueprint last season for MVP contention on the back of a dominant, high-usage-rate campaign. Harden\u2019s 36.1 points per game were the seventh most in league history, and became a necessity for a Rockets squad struggling with injuries to Chris Paul, Eric Gordon, and Clint Capela. Without their usual band of gunslingers, it was imperative that Harden launch almost double the number of shots as his next closest teammate. Harden finished the season with the second-highest usage rate of all time (40.5 percent). (Curry, meanwhile, topped out at 32.6 percent in his second MVP campaign, good for 74th all time.) And though Harden ended up finishing just short of his second MVP award, he was quick to defend his season, and criticize the media story lines that he felt lost him the accolade.\n\nThe narrative, Harden posited, had as much influence on who took the award as his play. How else could he have lost to Giannis Antetokounmpo after dropping \u201ca 32-game 30-point streak, eight 50-point games, [and] two 60-point games in one season.\u201d Last week, Harden told GQ he believed it was too early for a narrative to take shape for this year\u2019s MVP race. With his announcement this week, Curry started molding it.\n\nFor the first time in half a decade, Curry\u2019s team won\u2019t enter the season as presumptive favorites to win the championship. Which means they will rely more on Curry than ever to keep them relevant in the title race. Each jaw-dropping pull-up and deep, deep 3 Curry attempts with deadeye accuracy will add to his MVP case. An increased workload doesn\u2019t come without potential pitfalls, though. Curry\u2019s ankles are infamous, and after his second straight season with fewer than 70 games played (following five with at least 78 logged), and more than 28,000 career regular-season and playoff minutes tallied, it\u2019s fair to wonder whether his body can hold up for a season of full-throttle, hero-ball hoops.\n\nBut if he leads the league in scoring, like Harden did last season, it might take a statistically anomalous campaign like Giannis\u2019s to stop him from taking home his third award. If he does so while keeping the Warriors at the top of the Western Conference standings, flanked for the first half of the season by Green, Russell, Kevon Looney, and Willie Cauley-Stein, it\u2019ll be hard to argue that the prize should go to anyone but him.\n\nMVP awards and historic seasons aren\u2019t determined in the offseason, but the groundwork for them is laid early. With his announcement on Wednesday, Curry placed the first brick in what might be his ultimate solo campaign. All summer, fans were bombarded with stories about dropouts, misplaced priorities, and failures abroad. By declaring his intention to play for Team USA, Curry has asserted himself as a prospective savior: He Who Will Avenge A Seventh-Place Finish. We won\u2019t see him on the floor for at least a few weeks, but it\u2019s already the Year of Steph.","similarity":0.9903339744},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/7\/6\/20684536\/demarcus-cousins-russell-westbrook-kawhi-leonard-free-agency","id":20448577,"title":"The Kawhi Leonard Aftershocks: Boogie Nights in L.A., and Westbrook on the Block - The Ringer","description":"The last major domino of NBA free agency dropped in the middle of the night, and now we\u2019re just watching the rest of the tiles fall where they may","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/o5ZGFpN7m-h6boybUj-yx93Jeow=\/0x0:3000x1571\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/18285116\/910830456.jpg.jpg","tags":"Front Page,NBA,NBA Free Agency,Sports","groups":["NBA Free Agency","NBA","Sports"],"author":"Danny Chau","date":"2019-07-06T17:30:39-04:00","content":"Basketball never sleeps, they say, and Kawhi Leonard sure put that notion to the test at the break of July 6. As most of the NBA-loving public took the morning hours to recover and recoil from the madness, teams have been hard at work angling their next moves. Here\u2019s a roundup of what\u2019s happened in the league after its landscape was shifted in the middle of the night.\n\nAccording to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, Boogie Cousins is joining the Lakers on a one-year, $3.5 million deal. He\u2019ll reunite with former New Orleans buddies Rajon Rondo and Anthony Davis in L.A, and complete the bizarre Face\/Off vibes that the Pelicans and Lakers have suddenly engendered. The union of L.A. and Cousins seemed inevitable. With Boogie discovering a nonexistent market for his services and the Lakers desperate for high-ceiling talents to round out their roster, the two parties needed each other. \n\nThe question now is how much Cousins has left to offer. The Warriors were forced to rush him back from a torn quad after losing the Finals war of attrition to the Raptors, and in that time Cousins showed all the good and bad of what he could be for this Lakers team. Boogie\u2019s playmaking ability has always been one of the most underrated parts of his game, and his willingness to shoot from behind the arc creates unorthodox offensive structure, but his already limited pick-and-roll defense was almost nonexistent against the Raptors, who tried to exploit his lack of lateral mobility as often as possible. Expecting long stretches of stellar play from Cousins is asking too much at this stage of his career; he\u2019s a bullpen player with enough stuff to get you a few leverage points in second-unit minutes, but far from the max-level player he was regarded as only a year and a half ago.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nUltimately, this is a play to make Davis\u2019s transition in L.A. as seamless as possible. His friendship with Boogie is well documented, and Rondo played a central role in the Pelicans\u2019 surprising playoff success in 2017-18. With Leonard now sharpening his knives across the hallway, the Lakers have gone all in on appeasing Davis: He\u2019s their superstar for now and later, and the team is doing right by giving him all the comforts he needs to get the Lakers back into the postseason. \n\nAccording to ESPN\u2019s Royce Young, he might be. Last month, the Thunder were reportedly shopping most of their roster to trim what was the highest payroll in league history last season, and Steven Adams was the most notable player reportedly up for grabs. But after the surprise Paul George trade early Saturday, it\u2019s clear that no one is safe. Not even Oklahoma City\u2019s one constant through the past 11 years. \n\nThe viability of a Westbrook-led squad has certainly seen better days. His team has made three consecutive first-round exits, and he\u2019s not getting any younger. Teams interested in acquiring the former MVP will have to dive into a risk-benefit analysis, and envision what Russ might look like in a more structured offensive system. \n\nThere will be interest regardless of fit. Jimmy Butler may have gone to Miami largely for lifestyle considerations, but Miami certainly has the contracts to make a Westbrook trade work. There might be too much overlap in skill sets with Butler and Westbrook\u2014they\u2019re both extra-effort, battering-ram All-Stars with questionable shooting ability\u2014but the prospect of those two closing a game together would be high drama. The Knicks were quickly turned into a laughing stock in the free-agency race, and were shut out (or shut themselves out) of a number of marquee meetings. Would they take a gamble on landing at least one tried-and-true star this summer? Or is that just the migraine-like trauma of Knicks past offseasons talking? Is Westbrook Daryl Morey\u2019s next big, counterintuitive swing for the Rockets, or would pairing Westbrook and James Harden, after all the MVP trash talk from Rockets zealots over the years, blow the brains of more than 70 percent of the Houston fan base?  \n\nWestbrook and the Thunder front office are right to explore trade options, but it\u2019s still a bit of a bummer. After cultivating the most promising young core in basketball\u2014which included three future MVPs and surefire Hall of Famers\u2014the franchise has one Finals appearance to show for it. Sam Presti has taken some wild swings over the years, and for the most part, has managed to keep the Thunder in the thick of things in the Western Conference. But we haven\u2019t seen Presti helm a full-scale rebuild since he first landed the job in 2007. Westbrook might not get traded this season, yet it still feels like the end of something in OKC. \n\nStanley Johnson, the no. 8 pick in the 2015 draft, has agreed to a two-year, $7.5 million deal with the defending champs in the aftermath of Leonard and Danny Green\u2019s departure from Toronto. Leonard is an all-time talent, a two-time Finals MVP, and two-time Defensive Player of the Year; Green is one of the most consistent 3-and-D wings in the league. Johnson, I can say for a fact, has this over both players: He was drafted in the lottery, and both Leonard and Green weren\u2019t.  \n\nDevoid of a superstar, this is where the Raptors have to make their moves count: on the fringes, where they\u2019ve developed a litany of excellent role players over the years. Johnson, who has become a journeyman of sorts in the past few months, will become their newest reclamation project. At 6-foot-7 and 245 pounds, Johnson has excellent size and strength as a combo forward, and is a player whose defensive instincts will continue to give him chances in the league. Johnson is a brutish one-on-one defender who has willingly taken up challenges against some of the best in the game. He has the strength and mobility to knock players like Kawhi and LeBron off their spots and at least make things uncomfortable. The problem has always been where he fits on offense. He is a career 29.3 percent shooter from deep, and doesn\u2019t have the burst or the handle to create his own shot. But it\u2019s fun to imagine a switchable frontcourt of Johnson, OG Anunoby, and Pascal Siakam causing havoc and creating easy opportunities on defensive stops. \n\nAfter a whirlwind year, Toronto has to recalibrate to humbler expectations. This is a year of watching cream rise from the crop, as the front office machinates about the big-picture future in the background.

The 17th-ranked team in the world\u2014which, by the way, was not considered one of the tournament\u2019s favorites to beat this U.S. team\u2014stared the two-time-defending World Cup champions square in the eyes and didn\u2019t blink. Turkey rode the inside-out craft of Ersan Ilyasova and the off-the-bounce juice of young wings Cedi Osman and Furkan Korkmaz to the brink of a hierarchy-shaking victory before a raucous crowd in Shanghai. \n\nThe Turks looked to have the U.S. beat twice but squandered each chance. First, Osman fouled Jayson Tatum on a 3-point try at the end of regulation, sending the Celtics swingman to the line for three free throws with the U.S. trailing 81-79 and just one-tenth of a second on the clock; he hit two of three to force overtime. Then, with Turkey holding a 92-91 edge in the last 10 seconds of the extra session, the underdogs missed four straight free throws\u2014two by Texas product and longtime EuroLeague guard Dogus Balbay after an \u201cunsportsmanlike\u201d foul (meaning the defender made no play on the ball) by Joe Harris with 9.2 seconds to go, and two more by Osman on the next possession\u2014to give Team USA new life.\n\nThe Americans took advantage, with Tatum snaring the defensive rebound, pushing the ball the length of the court, and dishing off to Khris Middleton, who drew a foul on his way to the rim. The newly maxed-out Bucks wing made his pair, putting the U.S. on top by one with 2.1 ticks left. A last-ditch look at a 3 by Ilyasova came up empty, and the U.S. survived, 93-92, to improve to 2-0 in group play and remain atop the standings in Group E.\n\nGregg Popovich\u2019s squad will wrap up Round 1 of the tournament on Thursday against Japan, who fell to 0-2 on the tournament with a loss to the Czech Republic. The Americans will be favored to go through into the second round undefeated. But Tuesday\u2019s game laid bare that this edition of Team USA has lost something: the ability to rattle its opposition.\n\nTurkey\u2014a team with three NBA players, plus a half dozen other players with EuroLeague experience\u2014looked wholly unafraid of the guys in red, white, and blue. Fair enough: What about this U.S. team, at this point, should scare anyone?\n\nMyles Turner\u2019s an imposing shot blocker, but that sure didn\u2019t seem to deter Osman when he drove the ball straight at him for an and-one late in overtime. Kemba Walker is an All-NBA player with a lethal stepback, but Scottie Wilbekin\u2014last seen by many American observers starring for the University of Florida and now a naturalized Turkish citizen who plays his pro ball for Israel\u2019s Maccabi Tel Aviv\u2014felt plenty comfortable going right at him off the dribble on his way to 12 points in 15 minutes off the bench. And Ilyasova\u2019s had more big-game international experience than every U.S. player combined, and he showed it, pouring in 23 points with 14 rebounds in 38 tough minutes.\n\nPrevious iterations of Team USA could rely on incendiary scorers, world-class defenders at every level, and an overwhelming avalanche of sheer, pure talent to bury lesser sides. We knew heading into the World Cup that the 2019 version wouldn\u2019t have that, which would leave the U.S. more vulnerable than it\u2019s been in modern history, but we still didn\u2019t know quite what the team would actually look like on the court. In a tournament-opening win over the Czech Republic, the answer seemed to be \u201ca swarming small-ball side with enough one-on-one scoring juice to get the job done.\u201d That wasn\u2019t enough to cow Turkey, who spent the bulk of the game sitting back in a 2-3 zone, betting the U.S. had neither enough shooting nor enough playmaking talent to unlock it.\n\nThe U.S. made 14 3-pointers but on 40 tries, which wasn\u2019t enough to deter Turkey from standing pat. The result, too often, was a stagnant half-court offense in which a U.S. ball handler drove headfirst into multiple red jerseys before either lofting a low-percentage runner or trying to thread a pass through a thicket of arms. The U.S. shot just 13-for-37 inside the 3-point arc on Tuesday and mitigated its 20 assists with 14 turnovers. That included five by Harrison Barnes, who struggled as a creative force against a set Turkish defense.\n\nOpponents will likely throw a lot more zone defense at Team USA as this tournament progresses. That means some member of the American frontcourt is going to need to be able to catch the ball in the middle of the floor, face the basket, and create a quality shot. Turner, by far the U.S.\u2019s best option in the middle through two games, doesn\u2019t excel in that sort of role, as evidenced by some of his awkward and wild drives against Semih Erden from the top of the key. Brook Lopez (four points, three rebounds, two blocks in nine minutes) lacks the playmaking touch to succeed in that spot. Mason Plumlee\u2019s a solid passer but doesn\u2019t offer the combination of shooting range and rim protection that Turner and Lopez provide; he was the lone American not to get into the action on Tuesday, after seeing just five minutes against the Czech Republic.\n\nIt\u2019s likely, then, that Pop\u2019s going to have to need a forward to play up a spot to get more passing, shooting, and scoring touch on the floor against zones. After a strong debut against the Czechs, Barnes (10 points on 2-for-6 shooting, six rebounds, five turnovers, four fouls, minus-1 in 28 minutes) didn\u2019t really fit the bill against Turkey. It\u2019s not entirely fair to ask Barnes to suddenly prove capable of doing a Draymond Green impersonation, but the U.S. will need better answers to handle what\u2019s coming.\n\nPopovich has spent the first two games searching for those answers. The best five he found on Tuesday came, briefly, late in OT: Turner in the middle, Walker at the point, and Harris, Tatum, and Middleton on the wings. It\u2019s a lineup that maximizes shooting, keeps a legitimate big in the mix to clean the defensive glass and protect the rim, and gives Walker the screen partner and runway he needs to create off the dribble. It\u2019s also one that didn\u2019t include Donovan Mitchell, who missed nine of his 12 shots against Turkey and made some costly mistakes\u2014like committing the blind-pass turnover that led to Ilyasova\u2019s go-ahead putback late in the fourth quarter, and grabbing the rim while soaring in for an offensive rebound late in overtime, drawing a goaltending violation that knocked a Turner putback off the board with the U.S. down by one.\n\nThe Jazz star shined in Team USA\u2019s first game and did make some critical plays, most notably when attacking the boards, but a team light on reliable scoring needs Mitchell to play more in control on offense\u2014or, failing that, to at least make more of the shots he\u2019s going to jack. His contributions could become even more important if the U.S. has to play without Tatum, who sprained his left ankle on the full-court drive that saved the game for the Americans. Tatum said after the game that he was already feeling better and that the injury didn\u2019t appear to be serious, but a U.S. team whose offense has looked scattered and inconsistent can ill afford the loss of a viable scorer who can dribble, pass, shoot, rebound, and defend.\n\nThe wildest thing about Turkey\u2019s performance and Team USA\u2019s near-death experience, really, is that nothing about it seemed all that wild. Thanks to the globalization of basketball resulting in an improving collection of talent all over the world, and the various mitigating factors that led to most of the best U.S. players staying home, this is what can, and probably will, happen at tournaments like these: more close calls, more thrilling finishes, and more honest-to-goodness chances for a U.S. team full of NBA players to lose games that count. It\u2019s not just Giannis and Jokic who can jump up and bite you. It\u2019s a no. 17\u2013ranked team with a sneer and enough experience to make you sweat it out until the final buzzer. This Team USA won\u2019t beat teams before ever setting foot on the court; they\u2019re going to have to earn it, every step of the way, from the opening tip through the medal round. Game on.\n\n\n\n","similarity":0.9896472692},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2020\/6\/9\/21284831\/nba-play-in-tournament","id":21048872,"title":"How a Play-in Tournament Would\u2019ve Altered Recent History - The Ringer","description":"How many new 8-seeds would the NBA have gotten if it introduced its new format a decade ago?

The top seven seeds in each conference will automatically qualify for the postseason bracket, but then comes a play-in wrinkle. If the no. 9 seed is more than four games back of the no. 8, the latter team automatically qualifies as well. If the no. 9 seed is close enough, however, then the two teams will compete in a brief play-in round\u2014it\u2019s too short to rightfully call a tournament\u2014in which the no. 8 seed must win once, and the no. 9 seed twice, to advance to the real playoffs.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that this structure will exist only in 2020, due to the abrupt and unprecedented shortening of the regular season. But commissioner Adam Silver has long sought heightened drama at the end of the regular season, and after the excitement of the organic play-in game between Minnesota and Denver on the final day of the 2017-18 regular season, it\u2019s also possible that the 2020 structure will serve as a gateway to play-in setups in future seasons.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nHow would such a system change the end of the regular season and the playoffs as we\u2019ve known them? Let\u2019s apply a play-in structure to the past decade of NBA seasons and observe the alternate histories, before taking some lessons from the experience to understand what play-in games might mean for the league\u2019s future. \n\nNew play-in matchups:\n\nWould the end of the regular season have been affected?\n\nNo. The Bulls clinched a playoff spot with a three-game winning streak to finish the season\u2014including a crucial win in Toronto in both teams\u2019 80th games\u2014and would have fought just as hard for the no. 8 advantage if a play-in system had been in place. No other team was close to the no. 9 spot.\n\nWhat about the \u201cactual\u201d playoffs?\n\nThe top-seeded Cavaliers handled the no. 8 Bulls with ease in the East\u2019s first round that postseason, winning in five games. Cleveland had home-court advantage and was a much better team than Chicago, so the Cavs had a 95 percent chance of winning that series. What if the Raptors had advanced instead? Cleveland\u2019s odds would have been 95 percent in that hypothetical matchup, too.\n\nNew play-in matchups:\n\nWould the end of the regular season have been affected?\n\nA bit, but not much. The Pacers had already clinched the no. 8 seed before the final couple games of the season, while Milwaukee edged out Charlotte for the no. 9 seed by one game\u2014but the Bucks won the season series against the Bobcats, so they wouldn\u2019t have needed a victory in their final game to qualify.\n\nIn the West, the only drama would have existed at the barrier between nos. 7 and 8. The Hornets and Grizzlies were tied with two games to go, but Memphis rested Zach Randolph and Tony Allen because the final regular-season games mattered only for seeding purposes. Had avoiding a play-in round been on the line, Randolph and Allen would have certainly played the 81st and 82nd games on the schedule.\n\nWhat about the \u201cactual\u201d playoffs?\n\nTop-seeded Chicago boasted a 96 percent chance of defeating the Pacers, and did so in a five-game gentleman\u2019s sweep after taking a 3-0 lead. The Bucks would have scarcely fared better; Chicago\u2019s odds against Milwaukee\u2014which it swept in four regular-season meetings\u2014would have been 96 percent, too.\n\nThe Western picture might have changed significantly. Memphis pummeled the top-seeded Spurs in the first round, pulling the 8-over-1 upset in six games. (It would have been five if not for Gary Neal\u2019s miracle 3.) Randolph and Marc Gasol combined for 36 points and 22 rebounds per game, and the Spurs shot just 44 percent (including 29 percent from 3) for the series.\n\nThe Grizzlies would have been favored against Houston, but would have been far from a sure thing to advance past a play-in round. It\u2019s possible that Dirk Nowitzki would have never won a championship if the system had been in place in 2011, and thus made it harder for Memphis to knock off the West\u2019s best team in the first round.\n\nNew play-in matchups:\n\nWould the end of the regular season have been affected?\n\nYes. The Knicks and 76ers entered the last day of the 2012 regular season tied at 35-30, but neither team fielded its typical starting lineup with mere seeding on the line. LeBron James\u2019s Heat were the no. 2 seed, too, so it\u2019s not as if the no. 7 seed was particularly favorable compared to the no. 8. (In fact, Philadelphia\u2019s Evan Turner admitted he wanted to fall to no. 8 and face the Bulls instead.) Check out these Remember Some Guys lineups:\n\nKnicks: Mike Bibby, Landry Fields, Iman Shumpert, Amar\u2019e Stoudemire, Josh Harrellson\n\n76ers: Jodie Meeks, Evan Turner, Craig Brackins, Lavoy Allen, Spencer Hawes\n\nSuffice it to say, the likes of Carmelo Anthony, Jrue Holiday, and Andre Iguodala would have played if the difference between no. 7 and 8 had been more severe. (The result, with New York finishing seventh, would have likely been the same as in real life: In their final game, the Knicks were playing the Bobcats, losers of 22 games in a row as they completed the worst season by winning percentage in NBA history.)\n\nThe West would have experienced even more jostling for position. With one week to go in the regular season, the Western standings were bunched near the cutoff point:\n\n6. Dallas, 35-287. Denver, 34-288. Utah, 33-309. Phoenix, 32-3010. Houston, 32-30\n\nAnd that final week included games like Denver vs. Phoenix and Utah vs. Phoenix. Ultimately, the situation resolved rather peacefully, with Denver, Dallas, and Utah all clinching playoff spots with time to spare, but a play-in system that incorporated three different inflection points (for the no. 7 seed, to avoid the play-in round; for no. 8, for the play-in advantage; and for no. 9, to qualify) would have inspired chaos.\n\nWhat about the \u201cactual\u201d playoffs?\n\nIt depends\u2014how much blame do the 76ers deserve for Derrick Rose\u2019s injury in Game 1 of the Chicago-Philadelphia series? Philadelphia was a much better team than its record reflected\u2014see that sparkling fifth-place ranking in net rating\u2014but the 76ers were also overmatched against the Bulls. After Rose\u2019s injury, though, Philadelphia advanced, and almost made it past Boston, too, before falling in Game 7.\n\nGiven its underlying team strength, Philadelphia probably would have advanced past Milwaukee in the play-in round anyway. That\u2019s bad news for Rose, but good news for fans of Uncut Gems, which prominently featured that Celtics-76ers series.\n\nIn the Western Conference, meanwhile, the Spurs handled the Jazz in a sweep. Houston would have likely posed equally feeble competition.\n\nNew play-in matchups:\n\nWould the end of the regular season have been affected?\n\nNot unless you care about the battle for the no. 9 seed between the 76ers and Raptors, who both finished 34-48\u2014the worst record for any no. 9 seed in the whole decade. The West had something of a crowd in the 6-9 range, but if anything, the regular playoff structure without a play-in round made that race more compelling because the loser of that group didn\u2019t have any chance at all to reach the playoffs, whereas with a play-in opportunity, it would.\n\nWhat about the \u201cactual\u201d playoffs?\n\nThe Bucks\u2019 first-round series was a yawner\u2014a four-game sweep with four double-digit wins for the Heat. The Rockets\u2019 first-round contest, their first with James Harden, was a bit more complicated. Harden\u2019s former team, Oklahoma City, took a 3-0 lead before beating Houston in six games\u2014a Pyrrhic victory after Thunder star Russell Westbrook tore his meniscus in a post-whistle collision with Patrick Beverley in Game 2.\n\nSo while the Rockets\u2019 presence in the playoffs might not have affected Round 1, it certainly influenced Memphis\u2019s upset over the Thunder in the next round. But, it\u2019s worth noting, Houston was a much better team than Utah that season and likely would have won the play-in round anyway.\n\nNew play-in matchups:\n\nWould the end of the regular season have been affected?\n\nYes\u2014in a bad way. Both conferences in the 2013-14 season saw a clear drop-off between the no. 9 and no. 10 spots, so with a play-in setup, both the Knicks and Suns would have coasted to a berth in the pre-playoff round. But the races would have been somewhat diluted if the no. 9 seeds had a fallback option instead of being forced to challenge for the no. 8 seed completely. That Western playoff race is one of the best in recent memory: Only three games separated the no. 6 from no. 9 seeds. Fighting for a top-seven or top-eight spot would have mattered, of course, but some drama would have fallen away if whichever team lost those battles would have still earned another chance to qualify.\n\nWhat about the \u201cactual\u201d playoffs?\n\nThe 1-versus-8 meetings in the 2014 playoffs were both unexpected delights. Entering the playoffs, neither matchup seemed all that close (nor would any hypothetical matchup have been):\n\nYet against the Pacers, the Hawks led 1-0, 2-1, and 3-2 before ultimately succumbing in Games 6 and 7; the series was so close that Indiana outscored Atlanta by seven points total across the seven games.\n\nDallas\u2019s performance was even more surprising. The 2014 Spurs would go on to set a record for most postseason blowout wins (12 different victories by 15-plus points), including a record-setting Finals bludgeoning of Miami\u2014but their toughest test came against Dallas in the first round. With an all-veteran starting lineup of Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n, Monta Ellis, Shawn Marion, Dirk Nowitzki, and Samuel Dalembert, and with fellow vets Vince Carter and Devin Harris leading the bench squad, the Mavericks pushed San Antonio to seven games.\n\nNeither no. 8 seed completed the upset chance, but it\u2019s hard to imagine a more compelling series than those the NBA actually delivered.\n\nNew play-in matchups:\n\nWould the end of the regular season have been affected?\n\nYes. Unlike in MLB, which decides regular-season ties with play-in games, the NBA uses tiebreakers in the case of a split no. 8 seed. That sort of anticlimax appeared in both conferences in 2015, when the Nets and Pelicans qualified for the playoffs because they won their season series against the Pacers (sans the injured Paul George) and Thunder (sans the injured Kevin Durant), respectively.\n\nWith a play-in system, the Pacers and Thunder would have had the opportunity to qualify via an actual game, as opposed to predetermined tiebreakers\u2014though that setup would have also dulled some of the drama of a fun final day to the regular season. That night, New Orleans eked out a win against San Antonio to qualify, while the Nets won and Pacers lost to send Brooklyn to the playoffs.\n\nWhat about the \u201cactual\u201d playoffs?\n\nAfter 2014\u2019s first-round fireworks, the 1-versus-8 matchups in 2015 were much smoother sailing for the favorites. The Hawks beat the Nets in six games; Indiana would have been a tougher matchup for Atlanta, the stats say. \n\nMeanwhile, Golden State swept a feisty New Orleans team, though viewers got at least one iconic Steph Curry moment out of the experience.\n\nNew play-in matchups:\n\nWould the end of the regular season have been affected?\n\nYes. The Pacers and Pistons were tied for the no. 7 and 8 seeds with just two games left; the Pacers won both while the Pistons, resting much of their starting lineup, split the mostly meaningless contests. Chicago and Washington (which finished 41-41) also would have battled to the final day for the no. 9 seed.\n\nThe Western situation looks similar to a few others earlier in the decade: Just two games separated the no. 6 and no. 9 seeds in the final standings, so they all jockeyed for position down the stretch but would have had one last reprieve if a play-in structure had been in place.\n\nWhat about the \u201cactual\u201d playoffs?\n\nThere was no drama in this set of 1-versus-8 series. Cleveland swept the Pistons, and Golden State beat the Rockets in five games, with its four wins coming by an average of 24 points.\n\nNew play-in matchups:\n\nWould the end of the regular season have been affected?\n\nYes, in a now-familiar way. Here, the East looks like the West has a few times, with just one game separating the no. 6 and no. 9 seeds. Nothing would have changed in the Western Conference: Portland clinched the no. 8 seed with two games remaining, and no other team was close to Denver in ninth place.\n\nWhat about the \u201cactual\u201d playoffs?\n\nIn a strange season for the East, the Celtics were one of the worst no. 1 seeds ever. Indeed, led by Dwyane Wade, Jimmy Butler, and Rajon Rondo, the Bulls sprung two upset wins in Boston, sparking cataclysmic concern\u2014only for the Celtics to win four consecutive games, none of which were particularly close. Maybe Miami would have been able to pull the upset that Chicago couldn\u2019t complete. \n\nSpeaking of not close: The Warriors beat Portland by an average of 18 points per game in their first-round sweep.\n\nNew play-in matchups:\n\nWould the end of the regular season have been affected?\n\nYes\u2014but with complications. Let\u2019s start in the East, where the danger of the no. 8 seed would have changed a few teams\u2019 behavior. Entering the final night of the regular season, the 44-37 Bucks, 43-38 Heat, and 43-38 Wizards could have all finished in eighth place. But the Heat rested Goran Dragic while the Wizards rested John Wall and Otto Porter; rest was more important than seeding without the threat of the play-in round in the event of a loss.\n\nIn the West, a play-in round would have sapped so much of the magic of the serendipitous final night, when Minnesota and Denver played\u2014and went to overtime\u2014while tied for the no. 8 seed. With a play-in format, that meeting would have essentially been Game 1 of a best-of-three series, meaning that singular, frenetic experience wouldn\u2019t have packed quite the same climactic punch. \n\nWhat about the \u201cactual\u201d playoffs?\n\nDespite a minor scare, the top-seeded Raptors survived against the Wizards, advancing in six games. The Warriors were finally removed from the West\u2019s no. 1 spot, and Houston continued Golden State\u2019s tradition by steamrolling its first-round opponent, in this case beating Minnesota in five games with three blowout victories in the process.\n\nNew play-in matchups:\n\nWould the end of the regular season have been affected?\n\nYes again. The Eastern standings were a mess entering the final day in 2018-19, and would have been even more thorny with the no. 9 seed up for grabs:\n\n6. Magic, 41-407. Nets, 41-408. Pistons, 40-419. Hornets, 39-4210. Heat, 39-42\n\nWithout the play-in round, the Magic and Nets had already clinched, and Detroit did so with a simple win. The extra cutoff points would have added several layers of enjoyment and scoreboard watching.\n\nWhat about the \u201cactual\u201d playoffs?\n\nThe Bucks swept the Pistons by a 24-point average, making for the second-largest shellacking since the first round switched to a best-of-seven format. The Bucks boasted a 95 percent chance against the Pistons, and would have held 96 percent odds versus the Hornets.\n\nWhat can we learn from this history? First, play-in matchups would occur frequently; the no. 8 and no. 9 seeds were within four games of each other in 18 of 20 circumstances in the past decade.\n\nBut it\u2019s more difficult to discern larger effects on the postseason picture. In other major American sports, lower-seeded teams routinely make deep playoff runs. Six wild-card NFL teams have won the Super Bowl. The Los Angeles Kings won the Stanley Cup as a no. 8 seed in 2012. In MLB, whose wild-card system is most analogous to the new NBA plan, winners of wild-card games are 7-9 against the no. 1 seeds in the first full playoff round. The 2014 Giants and 2019 Nationals both won the World Series after emerging from the play-in game. \n\nYet in the NBA, it\u2019s improbable to think that a no. 8 or 9 seed might ever have that chance. The 1999 Knicks, a no. 8 seed in the shortened lockout season, are the only no. 8 seed to win more than one playoff round. More broadly, only five no. 8 seeds have won a playoff series in the 36 years of 16-team brackets; two came in the past decade, but one of those was the result of a devastating injury to the no. 1 team\u2019s best player. (The 2011 Grizzlies also benefited from a fluke injury, as Manu Ginobili broke his arm in the Spurs\u2019 final regular-season game. He still played five of six games against Memphis, though.)\n\nThus, from an actual championship perspective, the play-in round would do little more than potentially swap out the no. 1 seeds\u2019 cannon fodder in the first round. And because the NBA standings hinge more on skill than luck, relative to other sports leagues, it\u2019s not as if the no. 9 seeds are especially deserving of playoff bids, either. On average, the no. 9 seeds that would have appeared in a play-in round in the past decade had a losing record. The Eastern no. 9 seeds were especially porous.\n\nSo the play-in round wouldn\u2019t be in place for real competitive purposes, nor for an overwhelming sense of fairness. It\u2019d be for entertainment, plain and simple\u2014it would add more inflection points to the standings, typically generate more meaningful games late in the regular season (while perhaps influencing tanking efforts), and artificially add games with postseason stakes before the actual postseason begins in full.\n\nTo that end, it seems that the spartan play-in round, with only two teams and minimal games, doesn\u2019t fully embrace its own nature.

The Americans\u2019 3-0 record in group play doesn\u2019t mean much\u2014none of their wins (against Czech Republic, Turkey, and Japan) came against a legitimate medal contender, and they needed a miracle to beat Turkey in OT. The road ahead is much harder. They face Giannis Antetokounmpo and Greece in their first game of second-round group play on Saturday, and it\u2019s unclear when Jayson Tatum (sprained ankle) and Marcus Smart (strained quad) will return. The Americans can still win a gold medal, but they have little margin for error. New U.S. head coach Gregg Popovich has to press all the right buttons for them to have a chance.\n\nPopovich is still figuring out his team. He has kept the same four healthy players in the starting lineup\u2014Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell, Harrison Barnes, and Myles Turner\u2014but has been doing a lot of mixing and matching behind them. He has used an 11-man rotation (out of a possible 12) and tried almost every possible combination of those players. The problem is that he doesn\u2019t have many well-rounded players to choose from. Pop has to rob Peter to pay Paul with his lineups: Shoring up one weakness just creates another. He needs to lean more on his two most complete players\u2014Khris Middleton and Mitchell.\n\nMiddleton struggled in the exhibitions leading up to the World Cup, but has shined since the games started to count. He has come off the bench in all three games, averaging 10.7 points on 47.8 percent shooting, four rebounds, 2.7 assists, and one steal in 18.9 minutes. The Bucks swingman is one of the most underrated players in the NBA because the biggest strength of his game is the absence of any defined weaknesses. He\u2019s one of the only U.S. players in China who checks every box on the court: He can create his own shot, stretch the floor, create for others, compete on the boards, and defend multiple positions.\n\nThere is no good reason for why Middleton is backing up Barnes. Middleton is averaging 2.7 assists and 0.3 turnovers at the World Cup while Barnes is averaging 2.0 turnovers and just 0.3 assists. Middleton has a much better feel for reading the floor and making plays on the move than Barnes. The former averaged 4.3 assists last season; the latter has never averaged more than 2.0 assists in seven seasons in the NBA.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nTeam USA needs to run its offense through a playmaking forward who can pick apart zone defenses. Turkey nearly pulled off the upset by packing the paint and daring the U.S. to shoot from the perimeter. The Americans will see a lot more zone over the next week, and they will need more than just good 3-point shooters to crack them. The key is a player who can see over the top of the defense and make quick decisions in the middle of the floor. Middleton is the only American player who is taller than 6-foot-6 and has an assist-to-turnover ratio better than 2-to-1. \n\nMitchell, who will turn 23 on Saturday, isn\u2019t nearly as polished as Middleton, but he\u2019s the best two-way player among the U.S. guards by a significant margin. He\u2019s averaging 11.7 points on 45.2 percent shooting, 4.0 assists, 3.0 rebounds, and 1.3 steals in 25.7 minutes per game. His second-half offensive explosion sealed the 88-67 victory over the Czech Republic, and his offensive rebound in the final seconds of regulation against Turkey allowed Team USA to send the game into OT. Mitchell\u2019s shot selection in the half-court can still be questionable, but his energy level has been crucial to the U.S.\u2019s success on both ends of the floor.\n\nMitchell is the closest thing to a link between this version of Team USA and the way it played for the last decade under Coach K: with dominant defenses that blitzed less athletic opponents, forced turnovers, and got out in the open court. At 6-foot-3 and 215 pounds with a 6-foot-10 wingspan, Mitchell is an elite athlete with the size, explosiveness, and length to defend any backcourt player at the World Cup. He\u2019s not the only good perimeter defender in the U.S. backcourt, but he\u2019s the only one who can defend without taking anything away on offense.\n\nA quick look at Team USA\u2019s other healthy players shows a lot of guys with holes in their games that can be exploited by elite teams: \n\nKemba Walker: Walker has been as advertised on offense, but his size (6-foot-1 and 184 pounds) makes him one of the biggest weak spots in the U.S. defense. There was nowhere to hide him against the Czech Republic, which started 6-foot-7 Tomas Satoransky at point guard and made a concerted effort to attack Walker in the post. There\u2019s a noticeable difference in the U.S. defense when their star point guard comes out of the game.\n\nDerrick White: White, who is coming off a breakout playoff performance with the Spurs, has balanced out Kemba well as his backup. At 6-foot-4 and 190 pounds, White is a huge point guard who can guard players at all three perimeter positions. The issue for him in China is that he has been reluctant to shoot 3-pointers: He is 1-for-5 from 3 and has passed up a lot of open looks. Team USA needs guards who can shoot defenses out of zones.\n\nJoe Harris: Harris, the designated zone buster, started for Tatum against Japan. But he struggled to stay in front of Yudai Baba, an undrafted free agent who averaged four points a game in summer league a few months ago. Harris might not be able to play extended minutes against elite offenses unless the U.S. plays a zone. Turning the medal-round games into a battle of zones would play into the hands of Team USA\u2019s biggest rivals, all of whom have less athleticism on their respective rosters but more shooting and passing. \n\nHarrison Barnes: Barnes, the lone holdover from the 2016 Olympics, can be effective within a more limited role. He\u2019s a solid 3-point shooter and versatile defender who can hold his own in the post and on the perimeter. But featuring such a limited playmaker is not a recipe for offensive success as they advance deeper in the tournament. \n\nJaylen Brown: Brown was the odd man out among the U.S. wings before Tatum\u2019s injury, playing only six minutes against Turkey. He was dominant against Japan, with 20 points and seven rebounds on 9-for-15 shooting, but it\u2019s hard to take much away from a game against an opponent that was so outmatched athletically. Brown is 2-for-7 from 3 (28.6 percent) at the World Cup and will have to prove that he can make outside shots and be effective in a half-court game. The best way to use him in this setting might be as a small-ball 5 who runs the baseline and takes advantage of cracks in the zone to catch lobs. \n\nMyles Turner: Turner has been excellent defensively, averaging 8.3 rebounds and 1.7 blocks in 21.1 minutes per game, but playing against a zone negates many of his offensive strengths. He is not comfortable making plays and needs his decision-making simplified as much as possible. Turner has yet to log an assist in China and his crucial turnover in the final seconds of regulation against Turkey should have cost the U.S. the game. \n\nBrook Lopez: It has been hard for Pop to find minutes for Lopez in China, even though the sweet-shooting 7-footer could be an even better zone-buster than Harris. Popovich starts Turner over Lopez because the former is better defensively, and has closed games using smaller lineups without either center.\n\nMason Plumlee: Plumlee could be useful at some point at the World Cup. He\u2019s a good passer for a player his size, and he\u2019s more mobile defensively than either Turner or Lopez. But he\u2019s mostly here to be an emergency big man if they need to buy minutes against someone like Nikola Jokic. \n\nTo be sure, the other medal contenders all have players in their rotations with weak spots of their own. There is no one team in China with as much talent as the U.S. The difference is that most national teams are built around a core of players who have spent years together, some of them for their entire lives. They know how to cover for each other and have a defined identity on both sides of the ball. The Americans, on the other hand, are one of the youngest teams in the field and few of their players have any experience playing together.\n\nThe U.S. is in good position to get out of group play. The top two teams from each first-round group are put in a second-round pool with two teams from another group, and the top two teams from that new group advance to the knockout round. Team USA (3-0) and the Czech Republic (2-1) will now play Brazil (3-0) and Greece (2-1)  in the second round. Brazil and the U.S. need to split those games, while Greece and the Czech Republic need to win both. In other words, the Americans\u2019 game on Saturday against the Greeks is do-or-die for Giannis Antetokounmpo but not for them. Pop still has time to find answers.\n\nBut the U.S. coach can\u2019t afford to experiment once group play ends and Team USA has to face talented and hungry teams like Serbia, France, and Spain. Unlike Coach K, he doesn\u2019t have dozens of lineup combinations that he can cycle between over the course of the game. He needs to cut down his rotation and keep Middleton and Mitchell on the floor for as long as he can. Those are the two guys on his roster who can be the glue to connect a group of flawed players into an effective lineup. Leaning on them is the best path to a gold medal for Team USA. It might be the only one.

On the Book of Basketball 2.0 feed, Bill Simmons and a rotating cast are redrafting every pick 1-13\/14, starting with 1996. Here, we\u2019re going deep on what actually did happen by choosing the best, worst, and Knicksiest move of each class with the gift of hindsight, and also looking at how the numbers would re-rank the lottery board today. (For reference, here\u2019s how the 2002 draft played out.)\n\nThe 2002 draft featured a strange cocktail of decorated college stars and complete unknowns. Teams either were dead set on finding the next Dirk Nowitzki or terrified of drafting the next Kwame Brown. Even Yao Ming, who went no. 1, was viewed as a massive dice roll for the Rockets: front offices weren\u2019t sure if the 7-foot-6 center was the second coming of Shaq or Shawn Bradley. Houston was rewarded for its courage, as Yao turned into a star and averaged 19.0 points and 9.2 rebounds during his career, making eight All-Star teams and five All-NBA teams before being forced into retirement because of injuries. Although he played only eight seasons, his career was by all measures a mammoth success, helping spread the game in his home country and leading to his induction into the Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nThe same can\u2019t be said for the four other big men taken in the lottery before Stoudemire (no. 9) came off the board. The Grizzlies thought they had a sure thing in All-American Drew Gooden (no. 4) out of Kansas, but he topped out as a serviceable role player. The Nuggets, in a moment of Dirk FOMO panic, took Nikoloz Tskitishvili at no. 5 (more on that later, obviously). Nene, who has had a solid but not-All-Star-level career, also went to the Nuggets at no. 7, and Chris frickin\u2019 Wilcox went no. 8 to the Clippers on the heels of Maryland\u2019s NCAA title win. That left a skinny teenager, long on red flags and upside, for the Suns to gamble on at no. 9. And did it ever pay off.\n\n\n\nAt his peak, Stoudemire was one of the best power forwards the league has ever seen. With a devastating combination of power and speed, S.T.A.T. was equally likely to hurdle, juke, or move you. He threw down the types of dunks that could rattle an arena and he produced the types of posterizations that led opponents to cower in fear when he was flying to the rim. In just his third season, he averaged a career-best 26.0 points, 8.9 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks while shooting 55.9 percent from the field. He served as the anchor for the run-and-gun Marbury Suns and the Seven Seconds or Less version once Steve Nash arrived. He won Rookie of the Year in 2003, made six career All-Star teams, and earned five All-NBA selections (including first team in 2007).\n\nBut microfracture surgery on both knees would ultimately rob one of the league\u2019s greatest athletes of his greatest gift. Even in second gear, Stoudemire was an effective, and sometimes dominant, big man. After signing a massive five-year, $100 million deal with the Knicks in 2010, Stoudemire averaged 25 and eight his first season in the Garden, but his numbers would decline from there, as did his games played. After playing 78 games his first season in New York, Stoudemire played 47 (of 66 games in the lockout season), 29, and 65 before being traded to Dallas in another injury-shortened season in 2014-15. \n\nStoudemire retired from the NBA at age 33, but he wasn\u2019t done playing basketball, at first signing with Hapoel Jerusalem in Israel and making appearances in China and the Big 3 before returning to Israel to play for Maccabi Tel Aviv. Stoudemire played 14 seasons in the NBA, tied for third most in his class, but you can\u2019t help but feel robbed when looking back at his career. What if Stoudemire\u2019s knees had held up? Heck, what if just one had? How high could he have carried the Knicks? How many more prolific seasons would he have put up? And would he have won a ring late in his career? It\u2019s a tough note to end on, but Stoudemire\u2019s career as a whole was something to behold.\n\nLook, I get it. Every NBA team was (rightfully) kicking itself for not drafting Nowitzki in \u201998. It was clear by Dirk\u2019s second season that the GMs who passed on him were never going to live this down. That led to two things: One, it helped validate the draft cases of other great young international players, like Pau Gasol, who was selected no. 3 in 2001. Two, teams became obsessed with scouring the globe for the next great international prospect, which led more than a couple into buying fool\u2019s gold, like Tskitishvili at no. 5 in 2002.\n\nThe 7-footer lasted only four seasons before burning out of the league, finishing with career averages of 2.9 points and 1.8 rebounds. He also ended his career with minus-1.6 win shares, the lowest mark of any player in the 2002 class and one of the worst marks of any lottery pick in history.\n\nSo why did the Nuggets take him? Before coming to the NBA, Tskitishvili played for Benetton Treviso in Italy, which was being coached at the time by none other than Mike D\u2019Antoni. In 11 games that season, the lanky 19-year-old averaged 6.6 points and 1.8 rebounds per game. I\u2019ve got nothing else to add after that. Somehow, someway, that and what must have been some very convincing highlights were enough to get him selected fifth. Remember, the Dirk FOMO.\n\nThe Nuggets mitigated the Tskitishvili damage by picking up Nene, the no. 7 pick, in a trade with the Knicks. Nene was a very productive big man for the franchise throughout his 20s, though Denver could have drafted Stoudemire or Caron Butler (who went no. 10), either of whom would have paired nicely next to the franchise\u2019s lottery pick the next season: Carmelo Anthony.\n\nBoozer was the third wheel on Duke\u2019s 2001 national title team after Jay Williams and Mike Dunleavy, who went nos. 2 and 3 in the \u201902 draft, but the power forward ended up being the most productive Blue Devil in his draft class\u2014and one of the most valuable players overall.\n\nBoozer averaged 16.2 points and 9.5 rebounds during his 13-year career, finishing second among his draft peers in win shares and box plus-minus, and first in value over replacement player (VORP). He made two All-Star teams and an All-NBA third team in 2008, and had career earnings of more than $146 million (arguably the most important metric of all). He was a dependable source of offense and a rugged rebounder, one of the unsung heroes of the Derrick Rose\u2013era Bulls, and one of the most successful second-round picks in history. His fall in the draft can likely be attributed to general managers overthinking things. Everyone assumed Boozer had already reached his ceiling as a junior at Duke and wouldn\u2019t have much upside. Instead, his prolific production carried over to the league, with the big man\u2019s arsenal and willpower being underestimated by scouts and executives (HOLDAT L).\n\nBoozer wasn\u2019t the only steal in the \u201902 draft. Despite a first round littered with busts, the second round produced six 10-year vets (compared to nine in the first round). Most notable: Matt Barnes at no. 46 (Grizzlies), Rasual Butler at no. 53 (Heat), and Luis Scola at no. 56 (Spurs). All three had long, fruitful careers, but the latter was a particularly big heist. The Spurs snagged the Argentine with the third-to-last pick, and when he came over five years later, at age 27, he contributed 10.3 points, 6.4 rebounds, playmaking in the post, and rugged defense for Houston. Scola would play 10 seasons for the Rockets, Suns, Pacers, Raptors, and Nets, developing a reputation as one of the most durable and reliable players in the league.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t so much unfettered hype around Jay Williams entering the league as there was unwavering confidence. Almost everyone was certain the Naismith Player of the Year would, at a minimum, turn into a 10-time All-Star. Sure, Yao offered more upside and intrigue as a potential game-changing behemoth. But the Duke guard was a lock to improve any franchise. Here\u2019s what Bill Simmons wrote back in 2002:\n\nYears from now, we will remember \u201cYao Ming over Jay Williams\u201d the same way we remember \u201cBowie over Jordan,\u201d \u201cTraylor for Nowitzki,\u201d \u201cCarroll for McHale and Parish,\u201d \u201cAguirre over Thomas\u201d and every other great draft day blunder in NBA history. I\u2019m not just predicting it, I\u2019m guaranteeing it.\n\nAs bold as this sounds now, few blinked at the time. Williams was so productive and electric at Duke that it was hard to imagine a scenario where his skill and poise wouldn\u2019t translate to the NBA. And while Williams experienced his fair share of struggles his rookie season (9.5 points and 4.7 assists on 39.9 percent shooting), we tragically never got to find out whether he would realize that tantalizing potential. A devastating motorcycle accident after his first season led to career-ending injuries, including a fractured pelvis, a torn ACL, and a severed nerve in his leg. Williams attempted a comeback in 2006, after grueling years of physical therapy, but never made it past the D-League.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to wonder what a healthy Williams would have done for the Bulls. Would he and Jamal Crawford have blossomed into one of the league\u2019s best backcourts? Would Williams have been able to get more out of Eddy Curry or Tyson Chandler in Chicago? And would the Bulls have used subsequent lottery picks differently (Kirk Hinrich in 2003 and Ben Gordon in 2004) if they weren\u2019t trying to fill their point-guard void?\n\nIf you think we\u2019re piling on with this category, you just aren\u2019t familiar with Knicks draft history. The 2002 draft was yet another stroke of genius. In a draft-day trade, the Knicks sent the no. 7 pick (Nene), prime Marcus Camby, and over-the-hill Mark Jackson to the Nuggets for damaged Antonio McDyess, Frank Williams, and a 2003 second-round pick (which became Maciej Lampe).\n\nMcDyess suffered a patellar tendon rupture early in the 2000-01 slate, and returned for just 10 games in 2001-02, averaging 11.3 points and 5.5 rebounds in 23.6 injury-cautioned minutes. That would have scared most teams off\u2014but not the Knicks, who were banking on the 28-year-old bouncing back to the 20-10 form he displayed early in his career. But like so many Knicks moves that maybe looked good on paper, this one fell apart. McDyess reinjured his knee in a meaningless exhibition game before he could make his official Knicks debut and was forced to sit out the entire 2002-03 season. Eighteen disappointing games into the following season, New York traded him to the Suns. While he would play seven more seasons in the league, including many productive campaigns as a role player with the Pistons, he was long gone from New York by then. \n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the trade, Camby gave the Nuggets six prolific seasons, leading the league in blocks three times and winning Defensive Player of the Year in 2007. He averaged 10.1 points, 11.1 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks during his time in Denver. Nene, whom the Knicks also traded away for McDyess, gave the Nuggets 10 seasons in which he mostly served as a starter, averaging a rock-solid 11.3 points and 6.0 rebounds along the way.\n\nSo, in essence, the Knicks gave away 16 productive seasons of frontcourt play in exchange for 18 injury-riddled games. Told you we weren\u2019t piling on.\n\nUsing a mix of two all-encompassing statistics\u2014Basketball-Reference\u2019s win shares and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s RAPTOR wins above replacement\u2014we calculated the peak and career value for each player drafted (and undrafted) since 1996. (Peak value comprised the top five seasons of a player\u2019s career.) Then, for each class, we ranked the players in three ways: by peak value, by career value, and by an ultimate blend of the two, using baseball\u2019s JAWS model as an example. The first chart shows the top 13 players according to these rankings, while the second looks at the lottery picks that didn\u2019t make the cut. An important caveat is that all of these rankings address regular-season performance only; feel free to mentally adjust placements based on playoff exploits.","similarity":0.9895498753},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2020\/3\/5\/21166020\/nba-draft-2020-european-prospects","id":20930061,"title":"Will NBA Teams Lean Overseas in the 2020 NBA Draft? - The Ringer","description":"With an unproven crop of prospects in the States, lottery squads could look to Europe this summer for the future of their franchises.

A weak group of Americans and a bumper crop of internationals means that at least three European players who never played in college could land in the lottery. That hasn\u2019t happened since Jonas Valanciunas, Jan Vesely, and Bismack Biyombo were taken in 2011. \n\nThe difference this time is that these Europeans all play on the perimeter. The 2020 trio is made up of Deni Avdija, an Israeli combo forward, and Killian Hayes and Th\u00e9o Maledon, two French point guards. NBA teams are no longer just searching for big men overseas. The rise of the 3-pointer over the past generation has put a premium on the more well-rounded offensive games that European guards tend to possess.\n\nThe hard part about evaluating European prospects is that they rarely get the same opportunities as Americans their age. That\u2019s what made Luka Doncic so special. He starred in the EuroLeague, winning MVP in 2018, before coming to the NBA. Most European prospects are stuck in smaller roles on their professional teams without getting to show what they can do against elite competition. That leaves NBA scouts to extrapolate from their performances against less talented players.\n\nFrank Ntilikina is the perfect example. He never averaged more than six points per game in two seasons as a professional before being drafted by the Knicks. His breakout performance came when he led France to a gold medal in the under-18 European championships in 2016, but he has not been able to replicate that success in the NBA, where his inability to create off the dribble against elite defenders has kept him stuck in the same complementary role.\n\nThe ways that Avdija, Hayes, and Maledon are being used in Europe will leave a lot of questions for NBA teams to figure out over the next few months. Here\u2019s a look at the biggest surrounding each. (All stats courtesy of RealGM.) \n\nThe same situation Ntilikina faced applies to Avdija. He\u2019s a role player in his day job with Maccabi Tel Aviv, averaging 4.1 points in 13.9 minutes per game in the EuroLeague. There are games when he doesn\u2019t do much beyond take a few open jumpers and move the ball around the perimeter. His role expands when Maccabi plays in the less competitive Israeli league, where he averages 12.4 points in 26.6 minutes per game. But Avdija started generating real buzz when he led Israel to a gold medal in the under-20 European championships last summer, averaging 18.4 points and 5.3 assists per game.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why he was so dominant in that setting. At 6-foot-8 and 210 pounds, he has great size for a perimeter player. Avdija isn\u2019t just a big man who dabbles at the 3-point line. He can initiate the offense and create shots for himself and his teammates off the dribble:\n\nBut most of his success comes from attacking mismatches, either big men who are too slow to stay in front of him or guards without the size to bother his shot. He\u2019s not going to have the same type of athletic edge in the NBA. \n\nThe windows will be smaller for him. He will have to tighten up his handle and become a better outside shooter. His 3-point shot has come and gone in his two seasons as a professional (31.6 percent on 2.5 attempts per game) and his free throw shooting (52 percent on 1.6 attempts per game) has been abysmal.\n\nThe biggest question is: How good can he be if he\u2019s stuck in a 3-and-D role? Avdija is a good enough athlete to survive defensively in the EuroLeague, but he\u2019s not long or fast enough to be an elite defender at the NBA level. He needs to be featured on offense or he could wind up like Dario Saric, another playmaking forward who has bounced around the league because teams preferred players with a more complementary skill set as their third or fourth option.\n\nThe team that drafts Avdija will have to be patient. He has shown the ability to be the most valuable type of player\u2014a big wing who can run the offense\u2014but he has a long way to go before he\u2019s ready to do that in the NBA, and an unclear path to getting minutes in the meantime.  \n\nHayes is an example of a player who has benefited from the greater opportunities that come with a step down in competition. He struggled in an off-ball role last season in a tougher French league and has blossomed this year after being moved to point guard in a less competitive setting in Germany. His numbers have gone up across the board:\n\nPart of his growth is the natural result of an extra year of development. But the change in his role might be even more important: He\u2019s more comfortable when he can play with the ball in his hands. Hayes is at his best when he\u2019s in control of the offense, which wouldn\u2019t have been possible had he stayed in France. \n\nHe plays like a modern NBA point guard. He\u2019s an excellent passer with great size (6-foot-5 and 215 pounds) who can knock down step-back 3s and pull up from far behind the line:\n\nHayes is a rhythm player who is more effective when he can pick and choose when to shoot instead of waiting for the ball to come to him. His 3-point percentages have improved as he has changed his shot profile. According to the tracking numbers at Synergy Sports, he\u2019s in the 84th percentile of players in Germany when shooting off the dribble and in the 13th percentile in catch-and-shoot situations. The difference is that almost half of his jumpers last season came in the latter category compared to less than a third this season. \n\nHis potential is obvious. Hayes is much more than just a shooter. He\u2019s an 18-year-old with the savvy of someone twice his age. He knows how to use the threat of his jumper to manipulate defenses, create openings for himself in the pick-and-roll, and find open shooters on the move from anywhere on the court. Hayes can already control the game and he\u2019s more comfortable operating in a half-court offense than most young point guards. \n\nThe concern with Hayes is his physical tools outside of his size. He\u2019s an average athlete without great burst off the dribble. That\u2019s where playing in Germany hurts him. He doesn\u2019t get as many opportunities to show what he can do against elite defenders. And there are plenty of times when his inability to turn the corner holds him back even at the lower level:\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know how he would do if given the same amount of responsibility in a better league. The team that drafts Hayes has to hope that he can figure how to use his size and skill to make up for his lack of speed, or that they can improve his athleticism on the margins in an NBA strength and conditioning program. The potential rewards are enormous. But so are the risks. \n\nMaledon is on the opposite end of the spectrum. He plays for Tony Parker\u2019s team (ASVEL Lyon-Villeurbanne) in the EuroLeague, where he has carved out a small but important role for himself this season, averaging 7.2 points on 46 percent shooting and 3.2 assists per game. \n\nHis biggest strength is his versatility. Maledon can do a little bit of everything\u2014he can run the offense, create a shot for himself, and slide between multiple positions on defense. There are no glaring holes in his game, which has allowed him to play both on and off the ball at ASVEL.\n\nAt 6-foot-3 and 170 pounds, he\u2019s smaller than Avdija and Hayes, but he\u2019s also a better athlete. The one thing they all have in common is that they play with more poise than most American teenagers, which makes sense considering their years of experience as professionals. Maledon plays under control and rarely gets rattled by the defense, and has a great feel for when to change speeds in the pick-and-roll and find his teammates: \n\nHe might have the highest floor of the three. The questions for him are more about his ceiling. Maledon doesn\u2019t have the weaknesses of Avdija or Hayes, but he doesn\u2019t have their strengths, either. The concern that European scouts have raised with me is that he may not have one thing that he can hang his hat on at the next level. He\u2019s a good athlete, passer, and shooter, but he isn\u2019t great at any of them. That\u2019s the profile of a solid backup point guard in the NBA, which is all that he has been in Europe.\n\nThe 18-year-old has never been given the keys to the offense as a professional. It\u2019s possible that a well-rounded young player with a high basketball IQ can be better than the sum of his parts. But a team that drafts Maledon high will have to hope that he can thrive in a role they have never seen him in before.","similarity":0.9890285134},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/sports\/2020\/4\/29\/21241314\/taiwan-super-basketball-league-finals-sim-bhullar","id":21005355,"title":"Previewing the Last Game in the Last Active Basketball League on Earth - The Ringer","description":"The 7-foot-5 Sim Bhullar and the Yulon Luxgen Dinos are about to take on Taiwan Beer in a winner-take-all Game 6.

So I\u2019m going to stay up until the wee hours of Thursday morning watching a 7-foot-5 guy try to win a championship in an empty gym. \n\nThe lack of sports in my life has been jarring. Normally, I write about sports during the day, because this is my job. Then I watch sports during the evening, because that\u2019s when sporting events happen. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m upset by the lack of sports so much as I am unsettled, like my circadian rhythms have been interrupted. So I\u2019ve sought out basically any sports-like product and bet small amounts of money on it. The soccer leagues in Belarus and Nicaragua have recognized that they\u2019re suddenly the most important sporting competitions in the world, and started streaming all of their games on YouTube. It\u2019s alarming that I know this. \n\nBut nothing has been as compelling as Taiwan\u2019s Super Basketball League. I learned the SBL was still playing games three weeks ago, in a New York Times article focused on the league\u2019s decision to play in a \u201cbasketball bubble,\u201d with all the teams training and playing in the same facility. That Times piece mentioned something important off-handedly: One of the league\u2019s non-Taiwanese players is Sim Bhullar, the 7-foot-5 Canadian who became the first NBA player of Indian descent during a three-minute stint with the Kings in 2015. (That\u2019s not an exaggeration\u2014Bhullar played for exactly three minutes.) I\u2019m extremely passionate about extremely tall basketball players; in 2014, I wrote that Bhullar was my favorite college basketball player to watch while previewing his New Mexico State team ahead of the NCAA tournament. \n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nSo I\u2019ve been watching Bhullar and the Yulon Luxgen Dinos. Since I live in Los Angeles, their games take place in the middle of the damn night\u2014but I\u2019m not really sure when I\u2019m supposed to be awake or asleep anymore. And on Thursday at 5 a.m. ET, I will watch the Dinos play in the winner-take-all Game 6 of the Super Basketball League Finals. (It will be streamed from the official FIBA YouTube account, which, oddly, keeps asking viewers for donations like it\u2019s a teen playing Call of Duty and not a wealthy international sports federation.) I should explain the phrase \u201cwinner-take-all Game 6\u201d: The Dinos\u2019 opponent, Taiwan Beer, were given a 1-0 lead to open the series based on their 25-7 regular-season record. So even though the Dinos have won three of the first five games, the series is technically tied 3-3. Honestly, I never thought I\u2019d root for dinosaurs, or anything, over beer.\n\nThe Dinos\u2014cute logo, by the way\u2014went 16-16 in the regular season, and thus are underdogs in the series. But they\u2019re the better team, which is why they\u2019ve won three of the five games. Bhullar is paired with Marcus Keene, who averaged 30 points per game for Central Michigan in 2016-17 to lead Division I. In the ultimate act of comedy, Keene is 5-foot-9 \u2026 20 inches and 220 pounds smaller than the mountain to whom he\u2019s passing. Sometimes, the Lilliputian Keene carries around his Gulliver; he\u2019s the team\u2019s leading scorer, and dropped 46 points to force Game 6. But Bhullar changes the shape of every game he plays. \n\nI\u2019ve watched a lot of super-tall basketball players, and Bhullar is different. Most 7-foot-5-and-taller players are stick figures with bodies that appear to have been stretched in Photoshop. When you\u2019re roughly two feet taller than the average human, it\u2019s difficult to add bulk. Bhullar, though, has a relatively normal frame that happens to be 7-foot-5. His listed playing weight in the NBA was 360 pounds, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that figure was too low. \n\nEven at a relatively high level of competition, Bhullar is tough to stop when he gets the ball. He shot 72.7 percent from the field in his first G League season in 2015. In Taiwan, his performance is comical. Bhullar won the SBL title in 2017 by leading the Dacin Tigers to a sweep behind four double-doubles and a 21-and-19 performance. This year, he didn\u2019t join the Dinos until March, and Bhullar won Player of the Week honors in four of the league\u2019s final five weeks. In the first round of the playoffs, the Dinos swept Pauian, a team with no players taller than 6-foot-10. Bhullar averaged 23 points and 20 rebounds while shooting 71.7 percent from the field. Nobody has ever looked as simultaneously dominant and bored as Bhullar does while half-heartedly shoveling the ball into the rim with a cavalcade of Taiwanese men hanging off his shoulders. (He\u2019s the big guy.)\n\n2020\/4\/18 Super Basketball League Playoff Game3 HL#Yulon beats #Pauian in 3 straight wins. Advanced into Championship which starts on April 21st. They will faceoff with #TaiwanBeer. pic.twitter.com\/ibcde6NTF5\n\nSo how have the Dinos managed to lose two games? Taiwan Beer, which has a 6-foot-11 player in the Ukrainian Igor Zaytsev, has kept Bhullar in check, holding him to six points in Game 1 and four points in Game 5. (Bhullar is averaging 10.2 points and 14.8 rebounds for the series.) And Bhullar comes with his limitations, as he is quite possibly the slowest player I\u2019ve ever seen. He moves like an ent. On defense, he looms in the paint while the other four Dinos scramble around frantically to make up for the fact that one of their teammates will not provide help defense or rotate under any circumstances. Yes, Bhullar is an imposing presence in the paint\u2014in 2015, he led the G League in blocks per game\u2014but that\u2019s not as significant as it\u2019d seem when opponents can get wide-open 3-pointers and midrange jumpers with a few passes and screens. \n\nWatching Bhullar feels less like watching basketball than an experiment to see whether a team playing six-on-five on offense can succeed if it\u2019s playing four-on-five on defense. I\u2019ll be up in the middle of the night to see whether the experimenters can win. It\u2019s the last basketball game in the last basketball league on earth, and I have no idea what I\u2019ll do when it\u2019s over.","similarity":0.988936007},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/9\/16\/20867920\/boston-celtics-team-usa-kemba-walker-jayson-tatum","id":20631961,"title":"Should the Celtics Be Worried About a Team USA Hangover? - The Ringer","description":"No NBA team was better represented on the U.S.\u2019s roster than the Celtics.

Which is to say no team had as much of a hand in its failures than Boston. Four Celtics\u2014Kemba Walker, Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, and Jayson Tatum\u2014made the trip to China, and all four were featured heavily in the rotation when healthy. Walker led the team in scoring at 14.4 points per game, and averaged the third-most minutes. Brown and Smart added 7.9 and 6.4 points per game, respectively, with Brown adding just over four rebounds per night. Tatum, limited by an ankle injury, scored 10.5 points with 7.5 rebounds across two games.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nUnfortunately, the games were hardly a springboard into the Celtics\u2019 first season out from under Kyrie Irving\u2019s puzzling leadership. The U.S.\u2019s roster rivaled the worst squads in Team USA history, and the team\u2019s seventh-place finish was its worst ever in major competition. With so many dropouts before training camp last month in Vegas, there were plenty of opportunities for any of the young Celtics to help carry this year\u2019s U.S. team to a title, and set themselves up for an even bigger season in Boston. Instead, they exit the competition having been part of the most disappointing unit in American history, with nagging injuries to two of its best young talents and a potential hangover looming.\n\nWalker is new to Boston, having signed a max contract in free agency, but the other three Team USA Celtics should be familiar with disappointment by now. Last season, the Celtics were a popular NBA Finals pick, coming off a 55-win season in which they fell one game short of the Eastern Conference title. But Boston fell flat. Infighting sprung up practically from the jump, and the team that many expected to be a 67-win juggernaut stumbled to 49 wins and a second-round playoff shellacking at the hands of Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks.\n\nGordon Hayward\u2019s falloff following a gruesome injury in 2017 and Irving\u2019s unique approach to motivating teammates were major reasons for Boston\u2019s disappointing season, but the big concern moving forward is how little progress its young core made after breakthrough 2017-18 campaigns. Tatum shone as a rookie in Hayward\u2019s absence, looking like a potential superstar to open the season before cooling and finishing third in rookie of the year voting. But his shot selection drew ire as a sophomore, and his improvement failed to match his lofty expectations. Brown and Smart, meanwhile, saw their contributions reduced in correlation to their playing time. \n\nAll could be reset for the young Celtics now that Walker is taking Irving\u2019s place; a rash of stories came out of Team USA training camp talking up the unique opportunity the four Celtics had to build chemistry. But without a medal to show for their efforts, it\u2019s starting to feel like four key members of a team expected to compete in the East added a bunch of extra miles on their legs for nothing. Last season, Walker ranked fourth in the league in total miles logged (209.3), covering more ground for Charlotte than similar do-it-all players Paul George and Damian Lillard did for Oklahoma City and Portland. Tatum topped Boston\u2019s leaderboard, running more than 180 miles, and Smart and Brown clocked in third and sixth on the team, respectively. Not only did they run hard during the season, but they added miles over the summer. Meanwhile, other teams\u2019 stars were home resting and recovering. \n\nTatum\u2019s sprained ankle kept him out of the U.S.\u2019s last six games of the tournament, though reports seem to indicate the injury isn\u2019t serious enough to threaten the start of his season. His coach, Brad Stevens, told The Boston Globe on September 3 that he didn\u2019t think the injury was significant. He added that he was glad his players were getting international experience.\n\n\u201cI always say the first road game of the year hits you like a ton of bricks. These guys are doing it in late August [and] early September,\u201d Stevens told the Globe. \u201cAt the end of the day, they\u2019re going to be playing 5-on-5 other places. I don\u2019t think you can get any better prep than doing what those guys are doing.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the optimistic interpretation of this summer\u2019s tournament. Despite the ugly finish, Walker was the U.S.\u2019s most consistent offensive weapon for the majority of the World Cup, reaching double-digit scoring in each of his seven games on 48.6 percent shooting from the field, and 38.5 percent from beyond the arc. At times, Brown and Smart looked superb during the tournament, providing lockdown wing defense. Each had his own highlight moment, with Brown swiping the ball against Japan and going coast to coast, and Smart frustrating Antetokounmpo in a second-round win over Greece. Even Tatum managed some flashy buckets before exiting the competition.\n\nJayson Tatum gets fancy on the finish.  (via @NBATV) pic.twitter.com\/XpB1igXPDy\n\nIf the Celtics once again experience a sluggish start to the season, fans and pundits alike will point to the minutes logged by their four representatives this summer as a cause. How dare they put their bodies on the line, they\u2019ll say, when they could\u2019ve been preparing for a grueling NBA season. If they start the season blazing hot, their Team USA experience will be lauded, with the players commended for pushing themselves against superior competition. As is true in the debate over the merits of success or failure in the preseason, it matters only if it proves what you think is right. Otherwise, it was just an exhibition.","similarity":0.988756597},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/9\/9\/20857415\/team-usa-fiba-world-cup-knockout-rounds","id":20621456,"title":"Team USA Is Getting Closer and Closer to Being Its Best Self - The Ringer","description":"But is that enough to survive the global powers awaiting as the FIBA World Cup turns to the knockout rounds?","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/EAgdAQm3mKltbq3qVTutRMIH-Xo=\/0x0:3000x1571\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19181690\/USAImproving_Getty_Ringer.jpg","tags":"Front Page,NBA,Sports","groups":["NBA","Sports"],"author":"Dan Devine","date":"2019-09-09T14:08:58-04:00","content":"It was the glass-half-full take, heading into the 2019 FIBA World Cup, so I wrote it: While this Team USA didn\u2019t have the marquee names and offensive firepower to hold a candle to the rosters of years past, it didn\u2019t have to beat its predecessors. It just had to have enough to spend two weeks beating the rest of the field in China. Well, after one week: so far, so good.\n\nThe U.S. remains undefeated, exiting the second group stage 5-0 after double-digit victories over Greece on Saturday and Brazil on Monday. Gregg Popovich\u2019s team now enters the single-elimination knockout rounds of the tournament, taking on a good and deep France team on Wednesday. A win there would bring a semifinal matchup with either Serbia\u2014whose dominant start to group play ended with a blitzing by Spain on Sunday but still looks like the toughest matchup for the U.S.\u2014or Argentina, led by star EuroLeague point guard Facundo Campazzo and the aging-but-still-potent Luis Scola, the lone remaining holdover from the \u201cGolden Generation\u201d teams that felled the U.S. in 2002 and 2004.\n\nBeyond that, the U.S. could meet old nemesis Spain\u2014which rounded into form with an impressive thrashing of the Serbs\u2014or Australia, which kicked concern over this iteration of Team USA into overdrive with a pretournament exhibition win that ended a 13-year American winning streak, and who are still undefeated and riding high after a thrilling 100-98 win over France on Monday. However the matchups shake out, it looks like a daunting path to an unprecedented third straight World Cup gold.\n\nBut the U.S. can ill afford to start thinking ahead; it can only focus on being its best self the next time the ball goes up. And after a brush with disaster against Turkey in its second game, Team USA has done a much better job of that.\n\nWhen the U.S. opened the tournament with a solid win over the Czech Republic, it looked like this team\u2019s performance would hinge on both the quality of its defense and star-caliber offensive fireworks from Donovan Mitchell. The latter hasn\u2019t remained true: The Jazz guard is averaging just 10.2 points in 25.3 minutes per game while shooting 42.6 percent from the floor and 32.1 percent from 3-point range. Mitchell has remained a vital contributor, though\u2014the U.S. is plus-102 in his 127 minutes, tops on the team\u2014thanks in part to his complementary facilitating (22 assists against five turnovers) and his work on the defensive end.\n\nDefense, on the other hand, has been Team USA\u2019s calling card through five games; the U.S. leads all quarterfinalists in points allowed per possession. \u201cThe defense is ahead of the offense, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Popovich told reporters after the win over Greece on Saturday. \u201cBut that\u2019s expected when you have 12 guys who\u2019ve never played with each other before. That\u2019s pretty easy to figure out.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. tightened the screws in the second group stage. The game plan against Greece wasn\u2019t all that complicated\u2014stay in front of reigning NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo as much as possible and overload the coverage toward him as needed; close out hard on Ioannis Papapetrou, the team\u2019s most dangerous 3-point shooter; and make everybody else beat you. You don\u2019t have to be all that clever to be effective, though, and Team USA executed well. Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart\u2014an undersized but ferocious fire hydrant, not unlike Brazil\u2019s Alex Garcia, who flustered Giannis in group play\u2014all hustled to deny Antetokounmpo position and make him work to get free. The off-ball defenders were active, flying around to shut down passing lanes and rotating hard to stay ahead of Greece\u2019s ball movement. The attention to detail paid off, as the U.S. held non-Giannis Greeks to 14-for-55 shooting (25.5 percent) from the floor, preventing Greece from mounting enough of an offense to really threaten the favorites.\n\nO\u03b9 \u0391\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af \u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03bd\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03bc\u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c8\u03ac\u03c7\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd, \u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd. \u03a0\u03af\u03c3\u03c9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03ac\u03bc\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1, \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b5\u03ba\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1. \u039f\u03b9 Kerr, Pierce, \u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9. #FIBAWC #USAGRE pic.twitter.com\/5SgitVn8ei\n\nIt certainly didn\u2019t hurt that Greece coach Thanasis Skourtopoulos (whose usage of his singular superstar came into question throughout the tournament) kept Giannis off the court for the entire fourth quarter to \u201cprotect and rest him\u201d for Monday\u2019s game against the Czech Republic, which could\u2019ve sent Greece on to the quarterfinals. But you don\u2019t have to apologize for the choices of others; you just need to take advantage of them, and the U.S. did, keeping the Greeks at arm\u2019s length en route to a 16-point win. (Giannis, by the way, fouled out on a questionable call with 5:32 to go against the Czech Republic on Monday. Greece was up by 10 when he exited, and held on to win 84-77 ... but it needed to win by at least 12 to advance, so the Czechs move on instead.)\n\nBrazil fared better for most of Monday, with guards Marcelinho Huertas and Leandro Barbosa finding openings in the pick-and-roll, Anderson Varej\u00e3o getting into the teeth of the defense for layups and whipping passes out of the post, and reserve V\u00edtor Benite coming off the bench firing, drilling four of his five 3-point tries for a game-high 21 points. Eventually, though, the U.S.\u2019s small-ball lineups began to tilt the game with a combination of quickness and aggression, stifling Brazil\u2019s flow to force missed shots and turnovers that could then turn into transition opportunities:\n\n  Defense leads to offense! #USABRA #USAGotGame   https:\/\/t.co\/U6RPjx3FuZ@Smart_MS3 pic.twitter.com\/mew0Psa3Q8\n\nDefense by Jaylen Brown helps spark Team USA spurt that has them ahead 59-48 with 3:44 to play in the third quarter. pic.twitter.com\/BIu2qFQtmV\n\nJaylen Brown the playmaker in transition pic.twitter.com\/AgFi2E7Ovi\n\nThat\u2019s the way this U.S. team has to play\u2014lock up on defense, push tempo in transition, and hunt easy baskets in early offense\u2014because it\u2019s still a work in progress in the half court. Team USA hasn\u2019t been shy about firing from distance (much, I\u2019m sure, to Pop\u2019s chagrin), attempting a tournament-high 32.4 3-pointers per game. The Americans are struggling to connect, though, shooting just 32.7 percent from deep as a team, and they\u2019re still working out the kinks against the zone defenses they could see more frequently in the knockout rounds.\n\nThey appear to be getting better at handling those, though. Saturday\u2019s win over Greece featured some improved ball and player movement to create better looks, and they more often flashed smaller players like Mitchell and Brown into the middle of the floor against Brazil\u2019s zone on Monday, removing playmaking responsibility from big men like Myles Turner and Brook Lopez by putting more dangerous attackers in positions to puncture the zone:\n\nJaylen Brown with another great assist pic.twitter.com\/5AHcS51rQX\n\nOne of the big questions of the knockout round will be whether this sort of downsized, uptempo, more-playmaking-heavy attack will stand up to scrutiny against bigger opponents. Can the U.S. afford to rely on Barnes and Brown as small-ball centers and power forwards against the likes of Rudy Gobert, Marc Gasol, the Aussie duo of Aron Baynes and Andrew Bogut, or a monster Serbian frontline led by Nikola Jokic? The opponents the U.S. may face all feature frontcourt players who can bang down low, clean the glass, and step out on the floor to either stroke a jumper or facilitate offense from the elbows. Maybe the U.S. can make up for the size mismatch by leveraging superior quickness and keeping its wings active as off-ball havoc-wreakers, but the run of play may tilt the other way, necessitating more minutes for Lopez or Mason Plumlee, which shifts the U.S. away from the style that\u2019s been most effective thus far.\n\nUnlike its predecessors, this Team USA has to consider harder choices and tough trade-offs; unlike the best American squads, it\u2019s got weaknesses that might be tough to paper over with sheer talent. On that score, though, it\u2019s not alone. France needed a very controversial Gobert deflection that should\u2019ve been a goaltending call to outlast Lithuania, and then lost to Australia thanks in part to the ongoing brilliance of Patty Mills. Serbia, a wrecking crew through four games, got drilled by Spain, which had previously battled to hold off teams like Iran, Puerto Rico, and Italy. Australia\u2019s tough on both ends, and has already beaten the U.S. once in the last month, but that just evened the score between the two teams.\n\nTeam USA\u2019s not going to suddenly import a peak LeBron or Durant. All it can do is keep smoothing out the rough edges in the zone offense, getting crisper on the defensive rotations, work on getting Jayson Tatum healthy and back into the fold after missing three games with an ankle sprain, and hope that, if their backs are against the wall, they\u2019ll be able to dial up a star scoring performance from Kemba Walker or Mitchell when they need it most. The bad news is, the U.S. isn\u2019t unbeatable. The good news, though? Nobody else is, either.","similarity":0.9887102246},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2019\/3\/7\/18253011\/wilt-chamberlain-nba-rebounds-record-andre-drummond","id":18017052,"title":"Why No One Will Ever Top Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s Final 40-Rebound Game - The Ringer","description":"Fifty years ago, Wilt grabbed 42 rebounds (not a typo) against the Celtics.

He topped the rebounding leaderboards, too, and took the league\u2019s crown in 11 of his 14 seasons, often averaging by himself what an entire frontcourt does in the modern NBA. But the 42 boards he gobbled up 50 years ago Thursday in an overtime win over the Boston Celtics represent his most relevant rebounding feat viewed from today\u2019s context.\n\nChamberlain\u2019s besting of Bill Russell on the boards wasn\u2019t just the most recent 40-rebound game; it was the last. As in, final; complete; etched, essentially, with chisel in stone. \n\nThe modern game has caused records to fall and statistical outliers to erupt at the same frenetic pace as its games are played. Russell Westbrook will average a triple-double over a full season for the third time in a row. James Harden can\u2019t stop climbing historical leaderboards. Klay Thompson set a record by sinking 14 3s in a game, just two years after teammate Steph Curry set the record with 13. Anthony Davis and Jusuf Nurkic posted quintuple-nickels (five each of points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks) just six weeks apart. Two of the 10 records Bill Simmons detailed in his Book of Basketball as the most unbreakable have fallen in the past four years.\n\nBut rebounds stand distinct, their records untouched, even from a distance, by modern man. The single-game record is 55, courtesy of Wilt in November 1960, which is so absurd from a modern vantage that it might as well be a million. There\u2019s a reason Joel Embiid told NBA Desktop that he considers Chamberlain the GOAT because of all his records. No team has averaged 55 rebounds per game since 1972-73\u2014which was Chamberlain\u2019s last season. No team has averaged even 50 rebounds per game since 1977-78.\n\nWilt\u2019s rebounding anomalies extend beyond just that record. For instance, according to Basketball-Reference\u2019s records, Chamberlain and Russell combined for 22 of the 24 40-rebound games in NBA history, as well as the top 18 single-season rebounding averages. Chamberlain tallied 25 separate 30-rebound games in his rookie season. That\u2019s more than there have been total 30-rebound games from every NBA player combined since he retired.\n\nSince then, Charles Oakley has the most single-game rebounds with 35 in 1988. Three decades later, even Oakley\u2019s mark looks unattainable: Dwight Howard\u2019s 30-board game last season was the league\u2019s first since 2012 and just the third since 1996.\n\nSo why are rebounds seemingly immune to other sorts of statistical inflation? Let\u2019s contrast Wilt\u2019s situation with that of Andre Drummond, who\u2019s averaged at least 13 rebounds per game every season since he was a rookie and led the league in three of the past four. If Drummond sought to claim the single-game rebounding record in 2019, three main factors would stand in his way. \n\nFactor no. 1 that suggests Drummond would struggle to challenge Chamberlain\u2019s total is that teams in 2019 don\u2019t take enough shots. The league\u2019s pace seems hectic this season, as teams attempt nearly 89 shots per game, the highest mark in 30 years. In 1960-61, when Chamberlain set the record, teams attempted ONE HUNDRED AND NINE shots per game.\n\nTo put that number in perspective, in the past decade, just four teams have taken 109 or more shots in a non-overtime game (and three of those four hit 109 exactly). In 1960-61, that was the average\u2014which means that teams went higher than 109 shots half the time; the night Wilt tallied 55 boards, his team took 128 field goals and 41 free throws. As Simmons wrote in The Book of Basketball about the pace-inspired wonkiness of this era, \u201cCompare the numbers from [then to now] again. Still impressed by Oscar\u2019s triple-double or Wilt slapping up a 50-25 for the season? Sure \u2026 but not as much.\u201d\n\nSo many more shots meant so many more rebounds, especially when combined with factor no. 2 in Wilt\u2019s favor versus Drummond: Teams in 2019 don\u2019t miss enough shots. In 1960-61, leaguewide field goal percentages had only just crossed 40 percent. All those extra shots often missed, and they often found their way into Chamberlain\u2019s giant paws.\n\nThe difference in shooting percentage between 1961 and 2019 would lead to about 8-10 extra rebounds per night in a single game, even before accounting for the former season\u2019s heightened pace. Accounting for pace yields a massive difference\u2014about an extra 40 rebounds every game for teams in the 1960s to chase.\n\nYet even if pace rocketed back to 1960s levels, and even if shooting percentages regressed half a century, Drummond still wouldn\u2019t challenge the record unless his coach were in on the scheme, too. That\u2019s because of factor no. 3: Players in 2019 don\u2019t collect enough minutes.\n\nCoaches and front offices understand the importance of rest much better than they did a half-century ago. Monta Ellis in 2010-11 is the last player to exceed 40 minutes per game over the course of a season, and no big man has done so since Kevin Garnett in 2002-03. That\u2019s a stark departure from more ancient NBA history, and from Wilt especially. Even more than his 50.4 points per game, Chamberlain\u2019s most unbreakable single-season record might be his minutes-per-game mark: 48.5 in 1961-62. Yes, he averaged more than a regulation game. Think that one over.\n\nMore broadly, last season, the league\u2019s top 10 rebounders averaged 32 minutes per game, the lowest on record. In Wilt\u2019s heyday, that average regularly topped 40. So in addition to the advantage prior-generation players had because of their era\u2019s pace, and in addition to the advantage prior-generation players had because of their era\u2019s field goal inaccuracies, prior-generation players were also allowed to play more.\n\nWhen Wilt or one of his rivals grabbed a bunch of boards in quick succession, they just kept going. Not so in 2019. As of the All-Star break, there had been 60 quarters in the past three seasons in which a player tallied 10 or more rebounds. Drummond himself has done it 11 times. Those aren\u2019t trivial totals; they\u2019re the precise pace needed to reach 40 boards in a game. But because of rest minutes, that kind of pace is simply unsustainable over a full game, or even just a half. Out of those 60 occasions, only one\u2014for Howard in his 30-rebound game\u2014yielded a 20-rebound half.\n\nUltimately, while Drummond might expect to be on the court for about 60 rebound opportunities in the average 2019 game, his half-century-ago predecessor would have expected to be on court for about 110. Wilt would have encountered even more, given his workload.\n\nThat disparity leads to the final piece of Wilt\u2019s rebounding puzzle. The secret of Wilt\u2019s extraordinary rebound totals is that compared to modern centers, he wasn\u2019t actually an extraordinary rebounder. Or, at least he was extraordinary in a different way.\n\nBecause of the lack of comprehensive play-by-play data for most of Wilt\u2019s career, we have exact rebounding percentages for only the final three seasons of his career. In those seasons, he grabbed 19.4 percent of available boards when he was on the floor. That\u2019s a lofty number, but it didn\u2019t lead the league during that span, and it would place him behind four active players on the career leaderboard in Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Dwight Howard, and Kevin Love.\n\nMaybe that tally isn\u2019t fair to Chamberlain, given that it comprises the end of his career rather than his peak. Luckily, we can tinker with some available data from earlier in Wilt\u2019s run. Let\u2019s zoom in on the three-season stretch from 1960-61 to 1962-63, when he produced the best rebounding numbers of his career and also played in 99 percent of all possible minutes. In the 132 Warriors games in that span for which Basketball-Reference has rebounding data, Wilt\u2019s rebounding percentage was 20 percent on the nose.\n\nThat\u2019s good! But not historically so, or even particularly notable next to totals from this decade. In 2018-19, 11 qualifying players boast a higher mark, and that group includes Embiid, who lauds Wilt as superior to Michael Jordan specifically because of records like these. Maybe Embiid should call himself the greatest.\n\nThe irony of Wilt\u2019s rebounding records is that more of today\u2019s centers are collecting a higher percentage of rebounds than ever before. The five seasons with the most qualifying players with a rebounding percentage of 20 or better are the five most recent seasons, as many traditionally sized rebounders leave the court (or spread out on it) and yield more space for the few remaining close-to-the-basket bigs.\n\nAnd that discrepancy carries single-game ramifications as well. Wilt collected 55 of 149 total rebounds in his record game. That\u2019s 37 percent. Drummond hit that mark in a game this season. Jordan did it three times. Hassan Whiteside did it four. In Wilt\u2019s final 40-rebound game\u2014the one celebrating its 50th anniversary\u2014his rebounding percentage was just 28 percent, as he benefited from playing all 53 minutes in a fast-paced overtime duel. That\u2019s barely more than Drummond\u2019s average now.\n\nThere are caveats, of course: Wilt\u2019s rebounding percentages would have improved if he hadn\u2019t had to pace himself for 48 minutes, and he would\u2019ve grabbed even more rebounds had the court been dominated by guards and wings instead of fellow bigs who he had to fight for boards. This exercise is meant to gaze in awe at Wilt\u2019s statistical hegemony, not conclude that he was Drummond or Whiteside with a heavier workload in a different era. At least his totals stand alone, a numerical testament to the unassailable mix of right player, right time, and right place.\n\nThanks to Mike Lynch of Basketball-Reference for research assistance.\n\n","similarity":0.9884893298},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2020\/5\/13\/21256513\/nba-playoff-underperform-lebron-james-stephen-curry","id":21020554,"title":"The NBA\u2019s Biggest Playoff Underperformers and Overperformers of the Past Three Decades - The Ringer","description":"Should the Big Three Heat have won more than two titles?

In that piece, we examined conclusions for individual players throughout their careers. Today, we switch to a team-centric view. \n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nFor a full methodological explanation, check out Monday\u2019s piece. For this edition, let\u2019s start with the following chart. Since the postseason bracket expanded to 16 teams in 1984, nine teams have had a 50 percent chance or better to advance past all four opponents to lift the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy. Eight of those nine won a title; the ninth blew a 3-1 Finals lead.\n\nBut the most interesting part of the chart is that the Warriors had only their third-best championship odds in 2015-16 despite setting a record for regular-season wins. They actually had a better chance at winning in both 2014-15 and 2016-17.\n\nThat prediction seems counterintuitive, but it makes sense upon a closer examination of the different factors that determine playoff success. First, the Warriors\u2019 73-9 record in 2015-16 overstates their team quality; their Pythagorean record, based on point differential, was 65-17\u2014identical to their 2014-15 mark and worse than the 2016-17 figure, after the team had added Kevin Durant. And second, the 2015-16 Thunder and Cavaliers were both much better than any opponent the Warriors faced on their first title run, while the 2016-17 team faced, on paper, the worst Cavaliers team of the three. \n\nCombine all those factors and it makes more sense why the 2014-15 and 2016-17 versions would have better championship odds. Team quality matters a great deal, and so does opponent quality\u2014the 1996-97 Bulls boast the second-best Pythagorean record ever, behind only the 1995-96 Bulls, but they faced a brutal slate of playoff opponents, so their title odds fell to 48 percent. (Of course, with Michael Jordan on the team, they won anyway.)\n\nToday, we will measure a number of notable teams from the past few decades, split into a few categories based on those factors: those that actually won titles, the top challengers who fell short of glory, and the memorable NBA teams that despite bouts of relevance, never came all that close to being a title favorite. \n\nNote: We won\u2019t cover every title-winning team here, only those that won multiple rings or at least came close to a second. A full list of champions and their winning chances is available here.\n\nThe most prolific winner in the \u201990s, of course, was the Bulls, who won six championships in eight seasons. That haul compared to an expected figure of 2.8 titles, as discussed in the Jordan section of the individual piece. (In 1993-94, the season Jordan skipped completely due to his first retirement, the Bulls\u2019 title odds were just 2 percent.)\n\nThe other team to win multiple rings in the \u201990s was the Rockets, which won despite incredibly unfavorable odds. The 1994-95 winner is well-known as the most unlikely champion in history\u2014the only team seeded lower than fourth in a conference to win. That season, Houston had a Pythagorean record of 47-35 and beat the Jazz (61-21), Suns (51-31), Spurs (57-25), and Magic (59-23) all in a row. Utah, Orlando, and San Antonio ranked first, third, and fourth, respectively, in regular-season performance. Houston\u2019s odds of navigating that entire stretch\u2014the most difficult for any champion in the 16-team playoff era\u2014unscathed, without home-court advantage in any round, was a mere 0.2 percent.\n\nBy comparison, the 1993-94 team that won Houston\u2019s first title was a juggernaut. Those Rockets were better (53-29 Pythag record) and handled a slightly easier playoff gauntlet, but the title chances were still on the low end, at 6 percent. Overall, from 1993 to 1999, the Rockets\u2019 expected title count was 0.1. Props to Hakeem Olajuwon and Co. for nabbing two titles when even one was a long shot.\n\nWelcome to the graveyard of teams that tried to win titles by building around foundational Hall of Famers, and would\u2019ve gotten away with it, too, if not for that meddling Michael Jordan and his Bulls. \n\nThis count starts with the SuperSonics, who amassed 1.1 expected titles from 1993 to 1998. For six consecutive seasons, the Sonics had the point differential of a 59-win team or better, and they had the NBA\u2019s best Pythagorean record in both 1992-93 and 1993-94\u2014but they continually fell short in the West despite that talent. The only time the Sonics reached the Finals in that stretch, they were unlucky enough to do so when the Bulls had the best statistical team ever; meanwhile, in both 1993-94 and 1994-95, when Jordan was waylaid by his baseball sojourn, the Sonics lost to vastly inferior teams in the first round. The mid-\u201990s Sonics underperformed in the playoffs by the widest margin of any team in the past few decades.\n\nA close second is the Jazz of that era, whose period of real contention with John Stockton and Karl Malone began in the 1988 postseason (when they took the Lakers to seven games in the second round) and ended in 2001 (when the pair\u2019s last 50-win team lost by one point in a winner-take-all game against Dallas in the first round). In that span, Utah tallied an expected title count of 1.0, meaning, yes, Stockton and Malone should have won a title at some point. It wasn\u2019t just losing to the Bulls, either; Utah\u2019s expected Finals count during this stretch was 2.5, versus two actual trips to the Finals, so they were on the low end of expected performance in the West, too. Houston\u2019s upset wins in 1994 and 1995\u2014the latter when Utah had the league\u2019s best Pythagorean record\u2014really messed up the plans of a whole lot of teams.\n\nAlso squandering opportunities to win in the \u201990s, particularly in the Jordan interregnum years, were the Knicks (0.7 expected titles between 1989 and 2000), Suns (0.6 expected titles between 1989 and 1995), and Trail Blazers (0.5 expected titles between 1987 and 1993). Phoenix actually had the league\u2019s best Pythagorean record in 1989-90, but they were only a no. 5 seed in the West, and a brutal bracket sapped their chances. \n\nHere were the best chances in a single season for each of these challengers, and the results.\n\nFew players were involved in as many memorable highlights from the 1990s as Reggie Miller: He scored eight points in nine seconds against the Knicks and hopped around like a toddler on a pogo stick after sinking a game-winner against the Bulls.\n\nUnfortunately for Miller and the Pacers, Indiana never entered the postseason with much of a title shot. During the entire run from 1995 to 2000, which included a Finals trip and a loss in Game 7 of the conference finals, Indiana\u2019s cumulative expected title was just 0.3. If Indiana had won, it would have done so as a real underdog.\n\nThe Cavaliers from 1989 to 1993, also with 0.3 expected titles, fit this characterization as well. In 1988-89, Cleveland had the best team in the league by Pythagorean record, but Jordan beat Craig Ehlo at the buzzer, and the Bulls eliminated the Cavs from the playoffs for the first of four times in close succession. Elsewhere, the Heat from 1997-2001 recorded 0.2 expected titles, and the Warriors from 1989-92, despite plenty of cultural relevance, checked in all the way back at 0.004 expected titles. As Jason Concepcion wrote for The Ringer, the Run TMC Warriors were the league\u2019s \u201cfirst true hipster team\u201d\u2014but they were never a real contender.\n\nThe Lakers won five titles from 2000-10 with two different iterations of the team. As covered in the individual piece through the lens of Kobe Bryant\u2019s playoff achievements, both sets of Lakers exceeded expectations. The 2000 to 2004 group that won three Finals and lost a fourth had just 0.5 expected titles, and the 2008 to 2012 group that won two Finals and lost a third had 0.6 expected titles.\n\nThe other biggest winner of the decade was San Antonio, with three rings, but we\u2019ll cover the Spurs in more depth in the 2010s because their run lasted eons.\n\nOut East, Boston\u2019s Ubuntu group won one championship and lost a second, but that record coheres with expectation: From 2008 to 2012, Boston collected 0.7 expected titles, almost all of that probability concentrated in the season they actually won. Earlier in the decade, Detroit fit a similar profile: The Pistons excelled from 2002 to 2008, entering the playoffs as a top-three seed every season in that stretch and reaching five consecutive conference finals, and won one title versus 0.8 expected titles.\n\nThe Cavaliers squandered the best chances to win a title in this era. In LeBron\u2019s first stint in Cleveland, the Cavs collected 0.7 expected titles, with both 2008-09 (43 percent) and 2009-10 (21 percent) representing robust chances that didn\u2019t even result in a Finals appearance. Cleveland\u2019s figure here, like so many in this piece, reflects the difficulty of winning a single championship: Cleveland boasted the league\u2019s best player and was even the East\u2019s best team two seasons in a row, and still the Cavs\u2019 title expectation in this span was less than 1.\n\nLike in the \u201990s, the Suns check in as a challenger that fell short in the 2000s, as well. With Steve Nash, Mike D\u2019Antoni, and the \u201cSeven Seconds or Less\u201d offense, the Suns were never a favorite to win the championship, but they had enough reasonable chances that, at some point, they might have been expected to hit. Overall, the Suns from 2005 to 2010 had 0.6 expected titles\u2014just as they did in their previous run of success, also sans title.\n\nOther teams in this category include the Kings, with 0.5 expected titles from 2001 to 2004 and the league\u2019s best Pythagorean record in 2001-02; the Magic, with 0.5 expected titles from 2008 to 2011 and the league\u2019s best Pythagorean record in 2009-10; and the Mavericks, with 0.7 expected titles from 2001 to 2007 and the league\u2019s best Pythagorean record in 2002-03. The Mavericks were a lot like the SuperSonics of the previous decade\u2014Dallas made and lost one Finals, but not with its top teams; the single best Mavericks team of that era lost in an 8-over-1 upset in 2006-07. At least the Mavericks and Dirk Nowitzki bounced back the next decade to triumph in the face of far worse odds.\n\nNew Jersey reaching back-to-back Finals in the early 2000s seems to say more about the state of the Eastern Conference post-Jordan than anything about the Nets themselves. From 1999 through 2003, the East went 0-5 in Finals series and 6-20 in Finals games. The Nets were no exception to this futility, winning just two games across their two Finals, by a combined three points. Overall, the Nets remained in contention from 2002 to 2006, almost the entirety of Jason Kidd\u2019s tenure, but amassed just 0.3 expected titles across that span. They\u2019re also partially responsible for this monstrosity:\n\nMy favorite hobby is looking up box scores of NBA playoff games from when scoring wasn't allowed pic.twitter.com\/WtVi7gQXwk\n\nIn the vein of teams that lost by horrifying scores to the mid-aughts Pistons, the Pacers across the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons also collected 0.3 expected titles. Had the Malice at the Palace not ruined their chances the next season, that number likely would have climbed higher.\n\nA trio of similar Western teams fit this category, albeit with far more distant title chances. From 2007 to 2010, the Deron Williams\u2013led Jazz had 0.1 expected titles. From 2006 to 2010, the Carmelo Anthony\u2013led Nuggets had 0.06 expected titles. From 2008 to 2011, the Chris Paul\u2013led Hornets had 0.02 expected titles. All three groups had at least one fun playoff run, but none ever tasted the Finals.\n\nA final team from this era with more cultural relevance than meaningful playoff opportunity never had one great season, but rather was consistently solid year after year. From 2005 to 2009, the Rockets were the West\u2019s no. 5 seed four times, with a Pythagorean win total in the low- to mid-50s four times, but they tallied just 0.1 total expected titles in that span. Just because the mid-\u201990s Rockets could win a title outside the top four seeds doesn\u2019t mean their descendants could: No other team has in NBA history, after all.\n\nAlthough LeBron\u2019s Cavaliers underperformed the first time around, both of his teams from 2011 to 2018 overachieved given initial playoff expectations. The Heat won two titles, versus 1.0 expected, and the Cavaliers won one title, versus 0.1 expected, as repeated matchups against the superior Warriors limited their probabilities each year. \n\nThe biggest winner of the 2010s was Golden State, which collected more expected titles than any team since Jordan\u2019s Bulls. In retrospect, it seems like something of a disappointment that the Warriors won \u201conly\u201d three championships in five years\u2014they lost a 3-1 lead in the 2016 Finals and might have won in 2019, too, if Durant and\/or Klay Thompson had remained healthy. Still, the Warriors check in at 2.2 expected titles, meaning they should be quite satisfied with the three rings they earned. In the past couple of seasons, as exhaustion set in, the team took some steps back performance-wise (falling from the mid-60s in Pythagorean wins to the mid-50s, a massive drop), and capable opponents like the Rockets and Raptors would have made it difficult for Golden State to romp to more titles, anyway.\n\nFinally, we have the Spurs, who have contended not just for five years, but for roughly three full decades. San Antonio\u2019s run is, itself, a collection of several runs that can be shaped in roughly the following fashion.\n\nThe Spurs were so dominant that they won five titles\u2014and still barely outperformed expectations, because they were so often one of the very best teams in the league.\n\nThe Bulls\u2019 period of contention in the 2010s was short but spirited. In both 2010-11 and 2011-12, Chicago, led by MVP Derrick Rose and defensive mastermind Tom Thibodeau, was the league\u2019s best team by Pythagorean record. Only a few other teams in league history have managed that back-to-back feat, and almost all won a title for their efforts.\n\nNo team since the 2010-11 and 2011-12 Bulls has had the best Pythagorean record two seasons in a row\u2014not LeBron\u2019s Heat or Cavaliers, not even the Warriors. But Chicago lost in the conference finals in its first playoff try; the Bulls beat the Heat by 21 points in Game 1 before Miami shut down Rose (who shot 35 percent for the series) and won in five. And in 2011-12, Rose tore his ACL in Game 1 of the playoffs, and Chicago was left listless as the eighth-seeded 76ers pulled the upset. Across those two postseasons, not accounting for Rose\u2019s injury, the Bulls had 0.8 expected titles. They haven\u2019t had even a 1 percent chance at a championship in any postseason since.\n\nLeBron vs. Chicago was supposed to be the East\u2019s best rivalry for years before being cut short, just as LeBron vs. the Thunder was supposed to be the best Finals rivalry. From 2010 to 2016, the Thunder amassed 0.6 expected titles but didn\u2019t win any, and made only one trip to the championship round. Oklahoma City kept smashing into roadblocks, of both its own design\u2014hi, James Harden trade after a Finals appearance!\u2014and the poor casting of lots. The best regular-season Thunder team by a considerable margin was the 2012-13 group, fresh off a Finals appearance and boasting the NBA\u2019s best Pythagorean record\u2014but Russell Westbrook hurt his knee in the first round. The Thunder reached two more postseasons with Durant and lost in the conference finals both times.\n\nFinally, the Rockets had 0.5 expected titles from 2015 to 2019, most coming from the 2017-18 season that won James Harden an MVP. On the one hand, it seems somewhat silly to suggest the Rockets had a 45 percent chance to win the 2018 championship when they had the NBA\u2019s best Pythagorean record, given that they had to go through the Warriors with Durant. On the other hand, the Rockets were up 3-2 in that series before Chris Paul missed the final two games due to injury, and they were even up by 15 points in Game 7, sans Paul, before 27 missed 3-pointers in a row doomed them to defeat.\n\nThe Lob City Clippers were a perfect mix of entertainment\u2014it\u2019s in the name, Lob City\u2014and basketball talent, and the roster was a complementary blend of creativity (Paul), shooting (JJ Redick), scoring (Blake Griffin), and rim-running plus defense (DeAndre Jordan). Alas, those Clippers never reached a conference finals, and they never had fantastic title chances, either, tallying just 0.2 expected titles during their 2012 to 2017 run.\n\nUnlike the Clippers, the Pacers of the same period reached multiple conference finals; like the Clippers, they also seemed to redefine basketball in their own particular way. While L.A. wowed crowds on offense, Indiana defined the concept of verticality on defense, with Roy Hibbert as the poster boy for the new NBA. The Pacers lost to Miami three postseasons in a row, at one point even pushing the best LeBron Heat team to a Game 7\u2014but Indiana\u2019s prospects were never all that strong, with just 0.1 total expected titles from 2012 to 2014. Like Hibbert, the Pacers could never get off the ground, and like Hibbert, they\u2019d soon fade from relevance as the predicted defensive revolution went awry.\n\nThe last team on this list is one of the most beloved in recent NBA history, but like with the Run TMC Warriors, that emotional connection was more a product of style and swagger than on-court contention. The Grit and Grind Grizzlies were never a top-three seed in the West and had a Pythagorean win total higher than 50 only once, so they tallied just 0.02 expected titles from 2011 to 2015. At least they live on in the hearts of NBA fans, not just in Memphis but across the country, quixotic postseason efforts be darned.\n\n","similarity":0.9883483648},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/2020\/8\/20\/21394936\/nba-draft-lottery-results-timberwolves","id":21158977,"title":"The Five Biggest Takeaways From the 2020 NBA Draft Lottery - The Ringer","description":"The Timberwolves have a good problem on their hands after landing the no. 1 pick.

Early reports are that it was a Western scrub jay. Fitting, because this year\u2019s 19-45 Minnesota squad was primarily composed of Western scrubs. \n\nThe top pick gives them an obvious chance to improve\u2014but it won\u2019t be an easy decision. Normally, it\u2019s very clear who should go no. 1. Last year, it was obviously Zion Williamson, and the year before that, it was obviously Luka Doncic. (Wait \u2026) But in this year\u2019s draft, there\u2019s no consensus. Anthony Edwards is generally considered the best player, but during Thursday night\u2019s telecast, ESPN\u2019s Jay Bilas described Edwards by saying, \u201cThe only questions about his game are his efficiency, decision-making, shot selection, and his defense.\u201d Other than that, though, he\u2019s great. The Ringer\u2019s draft guide lists Killian Hayes as the top player, but not the most likely top pick. James Wiseman used to be considered the no. 1 top pick, and the player you\u2019ve probably heard the most about is LaMelo Ball. \n\nOf course, the recent Timberwolves have made a pretty strong argument against the concept of going all in on no. 1 picks. Minnesota had the top pick in the 2014 draft (Andrew Wiggins) and the top pick in the 2015 draft (Karl-Anthony Towns) for the last five years. For one year, they even had the no. 1 pick from the 2013 draft on their roster too (Anthony Bennett), but it\u2019s best we don\u2019t talk about that. This glut of highly selected young talent has added up to exactly one playoff berth, in 2018, when the Wolves were the no. 8 seed and won a single game. Earlier this year, they pressed reset and traded Wiggins for Russell. \n\nExpert analysis on every prospect\n\nThe top pick seems equally exciting and troubling for Minnesota. On the one hand, it\u2019s impossible not to be excited about a core of Russell, Towns, and whichever pick they make in October. On the other hand, we\u2019re already yelling about whether Minnesota should draft the best player available, or find the player who best complements Towns and Russell. If the Wolves swing and miss, they\u2019re in for a repeat of the Wiggins-Towns era\u2014and the possibility for a miss is higher this year than most. \n\nLet\u2019s look at some more takeaways from lottery night \u2026 \n\nThe 2020 #NBADraftLottery order is set. pic.twitter.com\/6PLlYKKhY3\n\nI\u2019m a fan of having the no. 2 pick. People will laugh at you for drafting Andrew Wiggins first, but they might not even remember that you drafted Jabari Parker second. Somebody else is making the tough pick for you.  \n\nSure, the Warriors didn\u2019t get the top pick after having the worst record during the regular season. But I think we can all agree that the Warriors are not basketball\u2019s worst team\u2014they have Steph Curry, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson. (And Andrew Wiggins! Who could forget?) Having the worst record in basketball doesn\u2019t make you all that likely to get the top pick, either. Under the new lottery odds, the team with the worst record has a 14 percent chance at the top pick, a 13.4 percent chance at the no. 2 pick, and a 72.6 percent chance of a worse pick than that. So no. 2 is a win for them. Golden State missed the playoffs because Curry and Thompson were injured. It was the first season Golden State had missed the playoffs since the first step of its dynasty eight years ago, and it will probably be the last time it misses the postseason for quite some time. The Warriors will either emerge with a young star to pair with their prime All-Stars, or use the pick as a trade chip to add a ready-made player. \n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nPlus, let\u2019s not forget that the Timberwolves landing the no. 1 pick helps the Warriors. Golden State received Minnesota\u2019s 2021 first-round draft pick when trading away Russell. The pick is top-three protected; Minnesota will probably be good enough next year to avoid ending up in the same position, but I bet it will still end up in the lottery. Even the bad things that happen to Golden State are actually good. \n\nSome people believe draft lotteries are rigged, and when people say that, they generally point to the surprise teams that overcome long odds to win the top pick. But I\u2019d point to the existence of the Charlotte Hornets\u2014the NBA\u2019s newest and perhaps most easily forgotten team. Since their expansion year in 2004, the Hornets had never moved up in the draft lottery order. They\u2019re so easily forgotten because they never seem to land good picks, which means they miss the playoffs almost every year, which means they go back in the lottery, where they once again get snubbed by the ping-pong balls. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. \n\nDespite missing the playoffs 13 times in 16 seasons, the Hornets had never gotten a lotto bump\u2014until Thursday. Even when they had the worst winning percentage in NBA history in 2012, they were bumped down from no. 1 to no. 2, missing out on Anthony Davis and instead getting Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. (Insert a YIKES of appropriate size here.) \n\nFinally, the balls bounced Charlotte\u2019s way this year. They\u2019ll get to pick third, a number that probably resonates with team chairman Michael Jordan. It puts them in perfect position to take LaMelo Ball\u2014whose dad, of course, said he could beat MJ one-on-one and seems to think LaMelo is an MJ-adjacent talent. That will certainly make the Hornets a lot less forgettable. \n\nFour teams fell at least two spots in the lottery as the Hornets and Bulls jumped into the top four, allowing us to laugh at their sadness: The Cavs fell three spots to no. 5, while the Hawks, Pistons, and Knicks each fell two. But you can\u2019t rake in big RTs with Cavs, Hawks, or Pistons jokes. You gotta go for that pure uncut Knicks misery.\n\nIt\u2019s the second straight year in which the Knicks have fallen two spots\u2014last year, they had the worst record in the league, but wound up with the third pick. This year, they had the sixth-worst record and will pick eighth. But that doesn\u2019t seem so brutal in a draft that has more depth than top-tier talent. There will be talent available. Now the Knicks just have to draft someone better than Kevin Knox. (To be fair, that\u2019s pretty much everybody.)\n\nA few weeks ago, I watched the NHL draft lottery, during which my beloved New York Rangers received the no. 1 pick. (I don\u2019t know much about hockey, but \u2026 I need an emotional outlet, considering the aforementioned Knicks fandom.) This year\u2019s NHL draft lottery was different from the others: After a bunch of format changes due to the pandemic, eight teams received even odds for the no. 1 pick. So they just threw eight ping-pong balls with team logos on them into a feeder and whichever logo showed up at the end got the top pick:\n\nIt was beautiful. We even got to see the Toronto Maple Leafs\u2019 ping-pong ball ding off the pipe and bounce out, a franchise impacted by sheer luck right in front of our eyes. \n\nJohn Tavares                Leafs' lottery ball                                                                     Hitting the post on an open net pic.twitter.com\/TvyTTXidW6\n\nThe NBA needs to do the same. I\u2019m sure it would have to change the format of the draft lottery to make it work, and I\u2019m sure it would make the process somewhat unfair, but I don\u2019t care. Enough of the behind-the-scenes process administered by Ernst & Young accountants in suits. I need to see the ping-pong balls bounce live. I\u2019m done with deputy commissioner Mark Tatum opening predetermined envelopes. I need to see him pluck a logo-emblazoned ball out of a hopper and tell us whose franchise just had their fate altered.","similarity":0.9883313775},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2020\/2\/18\/21141286\/nba-buzzer-beaters-leaders-history","id":20905327,"title":"The NBA\u2019s All-Time Leaders in Game-Winning Buzzer-Beaters - The Ringer","description":"Who\u2019s the greatest closer in basketball history?

Some of the most indelible moments in basketball history are buzzer-beaters: Jerry West\u2019s 60-footer in the 1970 NBA Finals, Michael Jordan\u2019s \u201cThe Shot\u201d over Craig Ehlo, Derek Fisher\u2019s fallaway with 0.4 left vs. the Spurs, Kawhi Leonard\u2019s quadruple-doinker to eliminate the 76ers in last year\u2019s Game 7 of the Eastern semifinals, Damian Lillard\u2019s \u201cbad, bad shot\u201d over Paul George to end last year\u2019s Thunder series, etc. It\u2019s basketball\u2019s version of the walk-off.\n\nBut while baseball fans can tell you that Jim Thome is MLB\u2019s all-time leader in walk-off home runs (13), NBA fans have had to settle for assumptions. Until now. \n\nI have compiled a database of every buzzer-beating, game-winning basket in NBA history (including the BAA years, from 1946-47 to 1948-49, since those are included as part of \u201cofficial\u201d NBA history; ABA years, however, are not included) over at Basketball-Reference.com, one of the websites for which I am the managing stathead. There have been 772 such shots, which I\u2019m defining as shots (a) taken with the shooter\u2019s team trailing or tied and (b) that won the game while leaving no time left on the clock. (For more on the specifics of the methodology, please see this blog post.) From that, we\u2019re able to determine the NBA\u2019s all-time leaders in buzzer-beaters. We\u2019ll start with 13 players who are tied for 11th most all time with four buzzer-beaters apiece: \n\nPosition: GSeasons: 13 (1947-50, 1952-62)Teams: Knicks, Celtics\n\nFrom 1950 to 1954, Braun won four games at the horn for the Knicks. Two of the four shots were described in game recaps at the time as \u201cone-handers,\u201d and the only one with a distance given was a 35-foot set shot he hit after catching an inbounds pass from Ernie Vandeweghe (father to future NBA star Kiki Vandeweghe and a medical student at the time) against the St. Louis Bombers in 1950. Braun was the first NBA player to reach two career buzzer-beaters (1950), and also the first to three (1953) and four (1954).\n\nPosition: FSeasons: 10 (1956-66; later played three seasons in ABA)Team: Hawks\n\nHagan, known as Li\u2019l Abner, would be the first of many to match Braun\u2019s record. Perhaps best known as one of two players (along with Easy Ed Macauley) traded by the Celtics to St. Louis for Bill Russell, Hagan had a Hall of Fame career and helped lead the Hawks over the Celtics to win the 1958 NBA title. His first buzzer-beater (in his rookie season) also happened to be the first buzzer-beater in the history of the NBA playoffs. Hagan tipped in Bob Pettit\u2019s miss to win Game 6 of the 1957 NBA Finals, forcing a Game 7 with the Celtics. Unfortunately, it was a Game 7 against Bill Russell, so I don\u2019t have to tell you that Hagan and the Hawks lost.\n\nPosition: GSeasons: 14 (1960-74)Team: Lakers\n\nNo surprise to see Mr. Clutch on this list. West became the first player to have multiple playoff buzzer-beaters. In fact, at the conclusion of the 1963 playoffs, the Logo had half of the four playoff buzzer-beaters in league history.\n\nOne of the best things about West\u2019s pair of postseason buzzer-beaters is that they were opportunities he created. In both instances, he stole the ball from a Hall of Famer (Sam Jones inbounding to Bob Cousy in the 1962 NBA Finals and Hagan in the 1963 Western Division finals) and then scored at the horn to win the game. \n\nIronically, West\u2019s most iconic shot, in the 1970 Finals, does not count here, since it forced OT instead of winning the game. West also famously won the 1972 All-Star Game at the buzzer, but that one doesn\u2019t count here, either.\n\nPosition: GSeasons: 13 (1975-88)Teams: 76ers, Clippers, Warriors, Cavaliers, Rockets\n\nTo no one\u2019s surprise, all four of the Brownsville Bomber\u2019s buzzer-beaters were unassisted, and three of the four were from 20-plus feet. Two of them were after Free grabbed offensive rebounds\u2014which Free did, on average, just 1.1 times a game.\n\nThe Free buzzer-beater that I most relish was one that did not qualify for the list. On December 21, 1977, against the Suns, he dunked the ball in the final seconds of an already decided game so everyone in attendance could win free hamburgers. So it\u2019s settled: The \u201cB.\u201d stands for \u201cBurgers.\u201d\n\nPosition: FSeasons: 11 (1977-87, 1988-89)Teams: Bullets, Warriors, SuperSonics\n\nBallard, while a productive player, is the first big surprise to join the four-buzzer-beater club. He\u2019s not a Hall of Famer, and unlike Free, he was never even an All-Star. Nonetheless, he won four games at the buzzer from 1980 to 1985. Ballard\u2019s game-winners came from an average of nearly 23 feet, and he was the first player to have four buzzer-beaters from 20-plus feet (something that would become more common as the 3-point shot gained prominence). While he hit just 93 3-pointers during his career, he was the first NBA player to hit two buzzer-beating 3s. \n\nPosition: FSeasons: 13 (1979-92)Team: Celtics\n\nOnly four buzzer-beaters feels a little beneath Larry Legend, but these were some truly special ones. Each of Bird\u2019s buzzer-beaters came in games in which the Celtics were trailing at the time of the shot. Before Bird, no one else had more than two such shots. \n\nBut perhaps the most astounding thing about Bird\u2019s buzzer-beaters is that they came in games that he dominated. He averaged 41.3 points in these four games: 38 at Phoenix in 1983, 48 vs. Portland in 1985, 32 vs. Detroit two days later, and 47 at Washington in 1987. No other player has multiple 45-plus-point games with a buzzer-beater. And no other player has ever won consecutive games at the buzzer like Bird did on January 27 and 29, 1985. Legendary.\n\nPosition: CSeasons: 14 (1980-94)Teams: Cavaliers, Pistons\n\nWhen you think of Laimbeer, you probably don\u2019t think of buckets. But he had a very soft shooting touch to complement his rugged game. Lambo became the first center with four-plus buzzer-beaters, all of them coming from 10-plus feet. His first career buzzer-beater came April 10, 1984, against the Pacers from 15 feet. His third career buzzer-beater came exactly a year later, also against the Pacers, from nearly the exact same spot.\n\nPosition: GSeasons: 19 (1984-2003)Team: Jazz\n\nThe NBA\u2019s all-time leader in assists and steals, Stockton was also one of the deadliest shooters in NBA history (his 60.8 true shooting percentage is 15th best in NBA history). Stockton\u2019s first career buzzer-beater came in 1989, when he took an inbounds pass 55 feet in 3.6 seconds and finished a layup over Michael Jordan (!). \n\nHis fourth and final career buzzer-beater was a 3-pointer over another Hall of Famer from the 1984 draft class: Charles Barkley. That one sent Stockton\u2019s Jazz to the 1997 NBA Finals. And since you\u2019re probably curious: Stockton\u2019s pick-and-roll partner Karl Malone had just one buzzer-beater in his career. It was not assisted by Stockton, but it was a tip-in of a Stockton miss in 1985 (the Mailman\u2019s 15th career game played). \n\nPosition: FSeasons: 13 (1986-96, 1997-00)Teams: Pacers, Timberwolves, Spurs, Hornets, SuperSonics\n\nThe Rifleman\u2019s four buzzer-beaters were spread out over 14 years (1986, 1989, 1995, and 2000). The first pair were with the Pacers, for whom he was the leading scorer for several seasons before the ascendance of Reggie Miller. The third came in his instant offense bench role for the pre\u2013Tim Duncan Spurs. The fourth was perhaps the most interesting. Person, then in his final NBA season, had played just three minutes (and not attempted a single shot) for the Sonics in their game against the Nets before being reinserted into a tie game with 1.7 seconds left. Nets star Stephon Marbury saw Person\u2019s 29-footer coming. \u201cThey put Chuck Person in the game for one reason: to take that shot. It\u2019s no secret. It\u2019s like when it rains, you are going to get wet,\u201d he said after the game. Person is one of just four players to hit a buzzer-beater on their only shot of the game. \n\nPosition: G\/FSeasons: 18 (1995-13)Teams: 76ers, Pistons, Wizards, Mavericks, Bucks, Heat, Hawks, Nets\n\nTo date, Stackhouse is the only player to hit buzzer-beaters for four different teams. The well-traveled wing hit one for the 76ers (1997), Pistons (1999), Wizards (2002), and Mavericks (2008). \n\nPosition: GSeasons: 13 (2003-16)Teams: Jazz, Bucks, Cavaliers, Clippers, Trail Blazers, Timberwolves, Hornets\n\nThe most notable thing about Williams\u2019s buzzer-beaters is their distance. Three of the four were 3-pointers, while the other was a 15-footer. But these weren\u2019t short corner 3s. All three of the triples were from 27-plus feet. Only one other player (who we will get to later) has hit as many from that far.\n\nPosition: GSeasons: 12 (2005-17)Teams: Warriors, Bucks, Mavericks, Pacers\n\nEllis\u2019s first buzzer-beater came in 2007, when his 17-footer off a pass from Baron Davis sank the Nets.\n\nIt\u2019d be six more years before Ellis got another. He then hit buzzer-beaters in three straight seasons for the Bucks (2012-13) and Mavericks (2013-14, 2014-15). Ellis scored 20-plus points each time he won a game at the horn and each shot came from 17-plus feet, though just one of them was a 3-pointer. \n\nPosition: FSeasons: 14 (2006-present)Teams: Grizzlies, Raptors, Kings, Spurs\n\nThough his trade to Toronto kicked off some glory years for the Grit and Grind Grizzlies, Gay remains the franchise\u2019s all-time leader in buzzer-beaters, with three (no one else besides Pau Gasol has more than one). His ability to get his shot off any time with his high release has been an asset for Gay late in games. He might not be done climbing these charts, either. Last season he hit his first buzzer-beater in more than eight years, giving the Spurs a win over the Suns.\n\nPosition: F\/CSeasons: 21 (1995-2016)Teams: Timberwolves, Celtics, Nets\n\nKG is the only player 6-10 or taller in NBA history to make at least five buzzer-beaters. He did most of his damage in this regard for the Timberwolves, for whom he hit four buzzer-beaters. He added a fifth as a member of the Celtics when he beat the Knicks with a 19-footer in 2009. \n\nAll five of Garnett\u2019s buzzer-beaters were 2-point jumpers, ranging from 12 to 21 feet. \n\nPosition: G\/F Seasons: 22 (1998-present)Teams: Raptors, Nets, Magic, Suns, Mavericks, Grizzlies, Kings, Hawks\n\nYou don\u2019t play in the NBA in four different decades by being just a dunker. Carter is the only player in NBA history with five buzzer-beating 3-pointers. In fact, no one else has more than three. \n\nHis buzzer-beaters have also averaged 28.8 feet in distance, with three of them coming from 30-plus feet. \n\nCarter\u2019s team was trailing at the time all five were taken. Additionally, three of the five came when his team trailed by two, so a 3 was the only way to secure the win. This includes his most recent one: a corner-3 dagger to give the Mavericks a 2-1 series lead over the top-seeded Spurs in the first round of the 2014 playoffs. \n\nPosition: GSeasons: 11 (2001-12)Teams: Warriors, Wizards, Magic, Grizzlies\n\nBefore his career fell apart because of injuries and questionable decision-making, Arenas seemed destined to rise to the top of this leaderboard. Late in his first season in Washington (2003-04), he knocked off the 76ers from 27 feet. The following season, his 14-footer toppled the Bulls in the playoffs. His fourth season in D.C. (2006-07) is when Agent Zero made his buzzer-beating legend, though. On January 3, 2007, his 32-footer beat the Bucks. Twelve days later, his 25-footer at the buzzer capped a 51-point performance in a win over the Jazz; it\u2019s the second-highest point total in history by a player who ended the game with a buzzer-beater.\n\nTwo months after that, he beat the Sonics with a layup at the buzzer, becoming the first player in NBA history with three game-winning buzzer-beaters in a season. But about two weeks later, he suffered a season-ending knee injury. He was never the same, averaging just 27 games over the next five seasons.\n\nPosition: GSeasons: 16 (2003-19)Teams: Heat, Bulls, Cavaliers\n\nWhile Arenas hit his handful of buzzer-beaters in a compressed window of time, Wade\u2019s five came during a 14-year span. He hit his first in November 2004, early in his second NBA season, defeating the Jazz with an unassisted 20-footer. His final buzzer-beater came almost a year ago, when he was blocked by Jordan Bell and then recovered the ball just in time to bank in a one-footer from 25 feet away to beat the Warriors. \n\nOf note, all five of Wade\u2019s buzzer-beaters were unassisted, including his epic strip of John Salmons followed by a running 3 at the horn to defeat his hometown Bulls in 2009.\n\nPosition: G\/FSeasons: 16 (2004-present)Teams: 76ers, Nuggets, Warriors, Heat\n\nIf you were told that one player from the Warriors\u2019 recent dynasty would be on this list, you probably wouldn\u2019t guess Iggy. Three of Iguodala\u2019s buzzer-beaters came as a member of the 76ers, which ties him with Hall of Famer Dolph Schayes for the most in franchise history. His pair for the Warriors are tied with several others for second most in franchise history (only Rick Barry has more). Four of his buzzer-beaters came on the road, and three came with his team trailing. Though he\u2019s back on the court with the Heat, he hasn\u2019t hit a buzzer-beater since January 3, 2014, at Atlanta, which was before he\u2019d won the first of his three rings. \n\nPosition: G\/FSeasons: 19 (1998-17)Teams: Celtics, Nets, Wizards, Clippers\n\nPierce isn\u2019t the all-time leader in buzzer-beaters, but no one has been involved with as many buzzer-beaters as the Truth. His seven buzzer-beaters tie him for the fourth-most makes all time, and his five buzzer-beater assists are the most ever. That\u2019s 12 buzzer-beaters he either scored or assisted on; no other player has more than 10. Despite being known for his 3-point shooting prowess, all seven of Pierce\u2019s game-winners were 2-pointers (which is tied for the most). \n\nSix of the seven were unassisted, and two of them were in the playoffs. \n\nPosition: FSeasons: 17 (2003-present)Teams: Cavaliers, Heat, Lakers\n\nOnce ridiculed by some for not being a willing closer\u2014like when he committed the grave sin of passing to Donyell Marshall for a great look\u2014or for lacking the supposed \u201cclutch gene,\u201d James has built up quite a buzzer-beater r\u00e9sum\u00e9 despite getting off to a bit of a late start. It wasn\u2019t until his sixth season that he hit his first, a 19-footer at Golden State on January 23, 2009. He followed that up with a 25-footer to beat the Magic in a playoff game that season:\n\nFour years went by before James sneaked one past Paul George for a layup off an inbounds pass in Game 1 of the 2013 Eastern Conference finals. He\u2019s added four more since (in the 2015 playoffs vs. Bulls, a 2018 regular-season matchup with the Timberwolves, and two in the 2018 playoffs). His five career postseason buzzer-beaters are as many as any two other players combined. \n\nAdditionally, LeBron and Russell Westbrook are the only two players to twice pair a buzzer-beater with a triple-double.\n\nPosition: GSeasons: 20 (1996-16)Teams: Lakers\n\nWhile LeBron has dominated the postseason buzzer-beater category, Bryant\u2019s seven regular-season buzzer-beaters are tied for the most ever. \n\nThrow in his one postseason game-winner (in the first round against the Suns in 2006) and he has one more career buzzer-beater than James. One interesting note about Kobe\u2019s buzzer-beaters is that his team was trailing at the time he made six of them. No other player had more than five in this situation. \n\nBryant hit four buzzer-beaters from 2002 to 2004 and then added the fifth in the 2006 playoffs, but he wouldn\u2019t hit another for more than three years. Then from December 4, 2009, to January 1, 2010, Kobe hit three buzzer-beaters in less than a month\u2014with the Lakers trailing at the time he shot each of them. The run of winners cemented his legacy as one of the most dramatic finishers in the history of the game. \n\nPosition: G\/FSeasons: 17 (2001-18)Teams: Celtics, Suns, Hawks, Nets, Heat, Jazz, Rockets\n\nDie-hard NBA fans know that Iso Joe could cook up some magic in late-game situations, but it\u2019s still incredible to look at this list and see him ahead of the likes of LeBron and Jerry West. \n\nTrue to his nickname, seven of Johnson\u2019s buzzer-beaters were unassisted (tied with Michael Jordan for most ever). \n\nJohnson did most of his damage in his three and a half seasons in Brooklyn, where he hit five buzzer-beaters. He\u2019d previously hit two for the Hawks and added one more for the Jazz in Game 1 of a 2017 first-round series against the Clippers; it was the only of his eight to come in the postseason. \n\nPosition: GSeasons: 15 (1984-93, \u201994-98, 2001-03)Teams: Bulls, Wizards\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the all-time buzzer-beater king is Jordan. His shots were all jumpers, ranging from 14 feet (1995 in Atlanta) to 26 feet (1992 vs. Detroit). Six were in the regular season (trailing only Kobe and Johnson), and three were in the playoffs (trailing only LeBron). Two of those three even ended the series. Seven were unassisted, which is tied for the most with Johnson. Jordan also averaged 34.4 points per game in the nine games he won at the horn, which is the highest average among the 11 players with five-plus buzzer-beaters (beating LeBron by a fraction). \n\nWhen Jordan retired for the first time, after the 1992-93 season, his four career buzzer-beaters were tied for the most all time. When he retired for a second time, five years later, he had twice as many buzzer-beaters as any other player in NBA history. And when he retired for a final time, after the 2002-03 season, he had nine career buzzer-beaters; no other player had more than four. \n\nJordan may one day lose this record\u2014LeBron certainly has a chance to catch him. But no other player stood above his contemporaries quite like His Airness in this particular statistic. I spent dozens of hours researching every close game in NBA history and learned what we already knew: MJ is the greatest closer of all time.\n\nMike Lynch is managing stathead at Sports-Reference.com.","similarity":0.9880479574},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2020\/7\/28\/21340980\/nba-restart-odds-explainer","id":21105021,"title":"How The Ringer\u2019s 2020 NBA Restart Odds Work - The Ringer","description":"What our new playoff odds calculator can tell us about the NBA now and in the future","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/DAtZ3aGLR68LG4KPb3qAk82GQN4=\/0x75:3000x1646\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/20535008\/kram_playoff_odds_explainer_getty_ringer.jpg","tags":"Front Page,NBA,Sports","groups":["NBA","Sports"],"author":"Zach Kram","date":"2020-07-28T08:00:08-04:00","content":"Which team will win the 2020 NBA championship? We\u2019ve been waiting to find out for more than a year, ever since injuries and departures incapacitated the dynastic Warriors and set the stage for the most wide-open title race in a decade.\n\nMore recently, we\u2019ve been waiting in stasis for months, with the COVID-19 pandemic forcing a postponement and, eventually, an unprecedented postseason situation, with 22 of the league\u2019s 30 teams decamping for Orlando, where they will remain sequestered and compete for a title. Given the strangeness of this season already, anything can happen on the NBA\u2019s new courts in the next few months.\n\nAnd with today\u2019s launch of The Ringer\u2019s NBA Restart Odds, we\u2019re here to help you make a bit more sense of the weirdness to come. Bubble integrity willing, the Restart Odds will update every night until an NBA champion is decided. Based on team strength as measured by point differential\u2014a historically strong predictor of success\u2014with adjustments for individual wrinkles like player absences, our playoff odds model includes three main features to help NBA fans navigate the weeks and months ahead:\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\n1. The Restart Odds show the single-game odds for each day\u2019s games. On reopening night, for instance, the Jazz are 60-40 favorites over the Pelicans, while the game between the Lakers and Clippers is close to a coin flip (51-49 percent in the Lakers\u2019 favor).\n\nMoreover, once the playoffs begin, the daily odds will reflect the importance of each game to the ultimate outcome of the series. We all know, intuitively, that a Game 4 between the Bucks and Nets with the Bucks ahead 3-0 wouldn\u2019t matter much, while a Game 4 between the Lakers and Clippers with the Lakers up 2-1 would induce a massive swing in the series. For viewers picking and choosing which games to watch on a crowded playoff night, the model can quantify just how much each contest matters. \n\n2. The Restart Odds show the play-in odds for various teams battling for the no. 8 and 9 seeds. If the team that finishes no. 8 in the standings is more than four games ahead of no. 9, it will automatically qualify for the 16-team bracket\u2014but if the two teams are within four games of each other, they\u2019ll enter a play-in period in which the no. 8 seed needs to win one game to advance, while the no. 9 seed needs to win twice.\n\nThe model will show the odds that various teams will finish eighth and ninth in their conference, as well as the chances of those teams forcing a play-in game. This portion of analysis is especially useful in the knotty Western Conference, in which six teams are fighting for two spots, and where a literal thousandth of a decimal point could mean the difference between a playoff appearance and an early trip home.\n\n3. The Restart Odds show each team\u2019s chances of advancing through various playoff rounds, from qualifying at all to winning the title.\n\nThe structure of the model holds up well historically when back-tested against more than 700 series since the invention of the shot clock. For instance, the model would expect the biggest favorites to win 94 percent of their series, and indeed, 94 percent have; it expects the favorites in the closest series to win 55 percent of the time, and they won 54 percent. On this graph, the blue line represents a \u201cperfect\u201d model, and the red line is the actual result. Outside of one blip, the two lines track each other perfectly. (A similar blip appears in the same spot on a graph of FiveThirtyEight\u2019s NBA playoff model. Reality is never quite as perfect as one would like.)\n\nOf course, given the uncertainty around this postseason, the Restart Odds also account for factors beyond basic team strength. They strip away home-court advantage, because every team is playing away from home. They also incorporate injuries and other player absences. But accounting for missing players is tricky because their production doesn\u2019t just disappear; their minutes are instead distributed to other players in the rotation. Rajon Rondo, for instance, has played worse than Alex Caruso this season\u2014so while the Lakers could end up lamenting the injured point guard\u2019s absence while he recovers from a broken thumb, they also might benefit from extra playing time for Caruso. It\u2019s hard to know in advance.\n\nSo the model handles absences from role players conservatively, and absences from stars with aggression. If LeBron James were to miss a game, naturally, the Lakers\u2019 odds of winning that contest would plummet. For now, pity the Wizards without Bradley Beal and Davis Bertans, their top two players by advanced metrics.\n\nThat\u2019s how the model works, broadly speaking. But what does it show to start? Here are three initial takeaways.\n\nI already explored the Bucks\u2019 favorite status at length earlier this month; read this piece for many more thoughts on Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, and the Bucks\u2019 historic dominance. \n\nBut the Restart Odds underline another reason to like Milwaukee\u2019s chances: their easier path in the Eastern Conference. The Nets and Wizards are sending depleted rosters to the bubble, so the Bucks are as close to a guarantee to reach the second round of the playoffs as possible. In the other conference, however, the Lakers will probably play Memphis or New Orleans in the 1-seed vs. 8-seed matchup, and while L.A. is still the huge favorite against any first-round opponent, there\u2019s a material difference between a 99 percent chance to advance (the Bucks\u2019 odds) and a 93 percent chance (the Lakers\u2019). Think about it this way: The Bucks have a 1 percent chance to lose before the second round, while the Lakers are seven times as likely to lose that early.\n\nThe Clippers\u2019 potential to lose early is even greater. Kawhi Leonard and Co. are essentially locked into the no. 2 or 3 seed in the West, so they will be forced to play a very good team as early as the first round. Their most likely first-round opponents are the Mavericks, Rockets, and Thunder; if they win the first round, they\u2019ll likely have to face the Nuggets or another viable team from the Western bunch. The Clippers, again, are favored to beat any of those teams\u2014math aside, I would certainly pick them to win\u2014but the challenges could stack up over the full postseason.\n\nThe Bucks would also be the clear favorite against any potential opponent in the conference finals, while a Lakers vs. Clippers clash would be roughly a 50-50 coin flip. That\u2019s another point in Milwaukee\u2019s favor\u2014though even with all those logistical advantages, the Bucks are still about as likely to lose the title as they are to win it. Good news: We\u2019ll all have reason to watch the games after all.\n\nThe NBA probably should have invited 20 teams to Orlando if it wanted to best balance more games (for more TV revenue) with more safety (via fewer players inside the bubble environment). But the 21st and 22nd teams in the standings, the Wizards and Suns, have a combined 1 percent chance of reaching the 16-team bracket. To make the playoffs, Washington first needs to make up two games on either the Nets or Magic, and then beat the no. 8 seed twice in a row in the play-in round. They\u2019d have to do all of this without Beal or Bertans. (The model estimates the new Wizards would win in the neighborhood of 20 games over a full season.) Meanwhile, the Suns need to leapfrog four teams in the Western standings just to have a chance at the play-in round, and have to do so while playing one of the most challenging schedules of any team in Orlando. \n\nWashington\u2019s first two games in the bubble come against the Suns and Nets\u2014a pair of barn burners to welcome the viewing public back to NBA basketball.\n\nThe most likely play-in result in the Western Conference would pit Memphis against New Orleans, followed by Memphis-Sacramento and Memphis-Portland. There is only an 11 percent chance of a play-in round in the East, versus a 91 percent chance of a play-in round in the West.\n\nOnly six teams boast at least a 1 percent chance to win the title; only 11, or half the teams in the bubble, are at 1 percent chance to reach the Finals. That number could change as play proceeds in Orlando\u2014a team like the 76ers has the talent, if not the track record, to make a run, and if they play well over their next eight games and boost their position in the bracket, their odds will surely inch upward. As matters stand now, though, there is a decent chance the 76ers will need to defeat the Celtics, Raptors, and Bucks in a row just to reach the Finals, so it\u2019s no surprise that their calculated chance\u2014below 1 percent initially\u2014comes in lower than a pure talent rating might suggest.\n\nIn NBA history, only two teams seeded lower than third in their conference have ever won the title: the fourth-seeded 1968-69 Celtics and the sixth-seeded 1994-95 Rockets. Teams seeded no. 1 have won more than 70 percent of the championships in the shot clock era.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the strangeness of the 2020 postseason will flip this usual dynamic and lead to more upsets and unexpected results. Maybe the lack of home-court advantage will hurt the top teams more than the math suggests; maybe the mental stress of playing inside a bubble inside a country riven by a pandemic will affect some players more than others. But even with all the swirling uncertainties, it\u2019s hard to bet against the teams with Giannis and LeBron and Kawhi as the most likely to raise this season\u2019s trophy. Keep track of the Restart Odds every day for the next few months, and you\u2019ll be able to see just how likely that is, from start to finish inside the bubble.","similarity":0.987975657},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/2019\/12\/3\/20993286\/a-different-fourth-quarter","id":20757327,"title":"A Different Fourth Quarter - The Ringer","description":"Kevin Clark suggests a change","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/MWnAu0QxIvC0JXTW7lX7uwRpTAs=\/0x0:5568x2915\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19426442\/1186234752.jpg.jpg","tags":"The Ringer Podcast Network,Sports,The Hottest Take","groups":["The Hottest Take","The Ringer Podcast Network","Sports"],"author":"The Ringer Staff","date":"2019-12-03T08:17:16-05:00","content":"Kevin Clark has a change for the last quarter of NBA games.","similarity":0.9878214598},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2020\/5\/27\/21238962\/redraftables-2004-dwight-howard-andre-iguodala","id":21003003,"title":"NBA Redraftables Reevaluations: How the Suns Sidetracked a Revolution - The Ringer","description":"The best, worst, and Knicksiest moves from the 2004 NBA draft class","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/WGus2bKwmSdSgWKWLO8ebYRdvpc=\/0x215:3000x1786\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19928956\/2004_redraft_getty_ringer.jpg","tags":"Front Page,NBA,Sports","groups":["NBA","Sports"],"author":"Zach Kram","date":"2020-05-27T06:20:00-04:00","content":"Draft season is here, even if the NBA season isn\u2019t, so we\u2019re taking a look back at some of the most interesting lotteries of the past 24 years. On the Book of Basketball 2.0 feed, Bill Simmons and a rotating cast are redrafting every pick 1-13\/14, starting with 1996. Here, we\u2019re going deep on what actually did happen by choosing the best, worst, and Knicksiest move of each class with the gift of hindsight, and also looking at how the numbers would re-rank the lottery board today. (For reference, here\u2019s how the 2004 draft played out.)\n\nWhile selecting the top pick for \u201cBest Move\u201d might seem too obvious, Howard\u2019s case fits for a few reasons. First, Howard is the only likely Hall of Famer from the 2004 draft; Basketball-Reference\u2019s model predicts a 99.4 percent chance for Howard\u2019s induction, versus 6.1 percent for Andre Iguodala, the second-best player from this draft. He\u2019s also the best player in Magic franchise history\u2014and, thanks to his combination of high ceiling and relative longevity in Orlando compared to the likes of Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Penny Hardaway, it\u2019s not close. By win shares, Howard is so far ahead of the Magic\u2019s no. 2 player, Nick Anderson, that Anderson is closer to 18th place than he is to Howard.\n\nAnd finally, grabbing the best player at no. 1 is no certainty, especially in a draft with a real debate\u2014in this case, Howard vs. Emeka Okafor. Howard was the nation\u2019s top high school player, tallying absurd statistics (25 points, 18 rebounds, and eight blocks per game as a senior) in Atlanta; Okafor was a three-year starter at UConn who had just won the Most Outstanding Player award while leading his school to the national title, with junior-year averages of 18 points, 12 rebounds, and four blocks per game.\n\nBoth projected as All-Star centers, but plenty of analysts advocated for Okafor given his track record against higher-caliber competition and the recency of his title run. The boss wrote in his draft diary that year, \u201cThe Magic are on the clock with the first pick. If they\u2019re smart, they take Emeka Okafor. If they\u2019re dumb, they take Howard. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that simple, though, because even though Okafor won the Rookie of the Year award in 2005, Howard soon bounded past his class rival. Okafor suffered from injuries and an inferior offensive game\u2014his scoring average declined every year of his career except one\u2014while Howard fulfilled Orlando\u2019s faith in him and more. The no. 1 pick became the best center of his generation, with eight All-NBA honors\u2014including five in a row on the first team\u2014plus five All-Defense selections and three Defensive Player of the Year awards. He also led the Magic to a Finals appearance, complete with an upset over the best Cavaliers team of LeBron James\u2019s first tenure, before leaving for L.A. and sending his career on a new, and much more winding, path.\n\nNo true bust appeared at the top of this draft: The top five picks all lasted double-digit seasons in the NBA, and the worst statistical career for that quintet belonged to Shaun Livingston, who overcame a horrific injury with the Clippers to play a key bench role for three championship Warriors teams.\n\nBut later on in the top 10, two more unfortunate careers emerged. Rafael Ara\u00fajo is the rare lottery pick with negative career win shares, after going eighth to Toronto, but given the broader team context, Luke Jackson edges out the Brazilian big man for most underwhelming high pick.\n\nJackson was an all-around star at Oregon, earning All-American honors as a senior after averaging 21 points, seven rebounds, and five assists per game, and shooting a scorching 44 percent from 3-point range. He seemed to be a perfect fit on a Cavaliers squad that was the NBA\u2019s worst from distance in 2003-04 and needed to start building a competitive roster around its 2003 first-rounder, LeBron James.\n\nUnfortunately for Jackson, James, and the Cavs, the lefty wing lasted just 73 career games as injuries and poor performance conspired to kick him out of the league early. And Jackson\u2019s busting set the tone for the rest of the Cavaliers\u2019 efforts to surround their singular star with appropriate talent. \n\nIn 2005, the Cavs didn\u2019t have a first-rounder, due to a trade from all the way back in 1998. That trade had initially included a lottery protection, meaning Cleveland would keep the pick if it missed the playoffs, but those protections were removed in a trade for Jiri Welsch midway through the 2004-05 season. The Cavs also included another future first-rounder in the Welsch trade\u2014and then got rid of him after just 16 games, during which he averaged 2.9 points and shot 24 percent from the field.\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of the Cavs\u2019 first-round picks with LeBron in Cleveland, the first time around:\n\n2004: Luke Jackson (no. 10)2005: No pick, traded in 1998 (with lottery protections removed in the Jiri Welsch trade)2006: Shannon Brown (no. 25)2007: No pick, traded for Welsch2008: J.J. Hickson (no. 19)2009: Christian Eyenga (no. 30)\n\nAs the team improved with James maturing into his prime, the Jackson pick represented their last chance to nab an impact player in the lottery. That effort failed, though, and even worse is the realization of the player Cleveland missed by one pick. As LeBron remembered in 2018, he wanted the team to take the player who went ninth in the 2004 draft: a future Finals MVP named Andre Iguodala. At least Jackson had a sweet shooting stroke on NBA Live.\n\n\n    Related\n  \n\nSandwiched in the draft between Ara\u00fajo and Jackson, much to LeBron\u2019s chagrin, Iguodala turned in the second-best career for any player in the draft. The 2004 class wasn\u2019t short on relevant\u2014and often beloved\u2014players picked later on: Al Jefferson, Josh Smith, J.R. Smith, Jameer Nelson, Tony Allen, and Kevin Martin all went after the lottery in the first round, while Trevor Ariza (more on him in a bit) emerged from the second.\n\nYet Iguodala stands out from the group for the various stages of his career. In eight seasons in Philadelphia, Iguodala started every game he ever played, averaged 15.3 points per game, and made an All-Star team. In eight seasons after leaving the 76ers, he started less than a third of his games, averaged 8.1 points per game, and won three championships and a Finals MVP.\n\nWhile Iguodala is now better known for helping to unlock the Warriors\u2019 switchable Lineup of Death, he was a darn useful player for the team that drafted him, effectively defining an entire era of 76ers basketball. Iguodala\u2019s first two seasons saw him serve as a sidekick for the other prominent Sixer with the initials \u201cA.I.,\u201d and he led the team in scoring in five consecutive seasons upon Allen Iverson\u2019s departure. In 2011-12, he helped engineer an 8-over-1 upset in the first round of the playoffs after Derrick Rose tore his ACL, and after Iguodala left Philly in the four-team Howard trade that summer, the 76ers hired Sam Hinkie within a year to begin the Process.\n\nJust a week after the 2004 draft, in which Phoenix held the no. 7 pick, the Suns signed Steve Nash in free agency. The team knew that upcoming rule changes to reemphasize hand-checking foul calls would allow for a more open offensive game, so they pounced early by adding the point guard most suited to taking advantage of that freedom. In 2004-05, Nash won the MVP award as the Suns improved from 29 to 62 wins and reached the conference finals; in 2005-06, he won another MVP trophy as the Suns reached the conference finals again; and in 2006-07, he finished as the runner-up in MVP voting as the Suns lost to the eventual champion Spurs in a wild second round. (See: Nash\u2019s bloody face and Robert Horry\u2019s hip check.) And Nash and the Suns did it all without their no. 7 pick from the 2004 draft. \n\nOn draft night, the Suns picked future All-Star Luol Deng, only to trade him to Chicago in exchange for the no. 31 pick (Jackson Vroman) and a future first-rounder. Vroman flopped, scoring a grand total of 16 points in 10 games with Phoenix; really, this trade was about securing additional cap space for the free-agent summer to come. With that extra money, the Suns signed wing Quentin Richardson to a hefty six-year, $48 million deal.\n\nExcept then the Suns traded Richardson after just one season, which meant they also needed to trade the first-rounder they acquired from the Bulls the previous year as incentive to take on Richardson\u2019s contract. In the meantime, Deng was immediately a good player as a rookie and a great one by Year 3. So to summarize, the Suns effectively traded the no. 7 pick in a strong draft for one season of a worse and more expensive player at the exact same position as the player who went no. 7.\n\nUnfortunately for Nash and the Suns, like with LeBron, Luke Jackson, and the Cavaliers, this 2004 maneuver initiated a pattern for the team\u2019s treatment of draft picks. The Deng\/Richardson debacle was merely an appetizer. But while Cleveland at least tried to find complementary players for James and couldn\u2019t identify the right ones, in Phoenix\u2019s case, owner Robert Sarver was seemingly more concerned with adding money to his books than any basketball players to his roster.\n\nIn 2005, the Suns traded Nate Robinson (the future first they\u2019d acquired from Chicago for Deng), then traded their second-round selection, Marcin Gortat, for cash. In 2006, armed with two first-rounders, they traded the first, Rajon Rondo, to Boston for a future pick, then traded Sergio Rodr\u00edguez to Portland for more cash. In 2007, they took Rudy Fern\u00e1ndez with the pick they\u2019d acquired for Rondo, only to immediately trade him to Portland for, you guessed it, cash. And before the 2008 draft, they traded their first-rounder, who became Serge Ibaka, along with their 2010 first-rounder just to be able to unload Kurt Thomas\u2019s contract, after they\u2019d acquired the veteran big man in the Richardson trade a few years earlier.\n\nHow might Nash\u2019s titleless career or Phoenix\u2019s titleless franchise path unfolded differently had Sarver used the draft for its intended purpose? Counterfactuals are impossible to predict with any certainty, but the Suns reached three conference finals between 2005 and 2010, and in that span, Deng averaged more than 15 points and six rebounds per game in Chicago while playing excellent, indefatigable defense on the wing. Deng was never a top shooter, and he chose to spend more time inside the arc than outside it. Neither was Shawn Marion, and he fit just fine in the Suns\u2019 system. A Nash\u2013Joe Johnson\/Raja Bell\u2013Deng\u2013Marion\u2013Amar\u2019e Stoudemire lineup would have combined slick passing with accurate shooting, speed with defensive range, and allowed for even more positional flexibility than those Suns teams actually possessed. \n\nThe Suns already came so close to a Finals trip; it\u2019s not hard to imagine Deng\u2019s addition thrusting them over the edge. And to widen the hypothetical even further, if the Seven Seconds or Less squad had won a title, could the pace-and-space revolution have arrived in the NBA even earlier? The Warriors\u2019 dominance in the 2010s spurred that movement once the rest of the league learned that such strategizing could win in the playoffs\u2014so did Sarver\u2019s complete disdain for the draft unwittingly set the NBA\u2019s evolution back a decade?\n\nBetween 1996 and 2005, the Knicks kept just two first-round picks. They used one on Frederic Weis (1999), who never played in the NBA, and one on Mike Sweetney (2003), who lasted just four seasons, two with the Knicks.\n\nThis draft was no exception, after New York traded its first-rounder\u2014and a future first, which rolled over all the way until it became Gordon Hayward in 2010\u2014in the Stephon Marbury trade. In 2004\u2019s second round, however, the Knicks struck gold, plucking Trevor Ariza out of UCLA with the 43rd selection. They nabbed a top-five player from this draft in the second round; what a coup!\n\nExcept the Knicks traded Ariza after just one and a half seasons, before he turned into a sturdy 3-and-D wing, flipping him to Orlando in the Steve Francis deal as they descended into cap hell. The next season, 2005-06, with Marbury\u2019s and Francis\u2019s contracts bloating the books, the Knicks spent more money on salaries (more than $125 million) than any other team did until 2016-17. Factor in a luxury tax north of $60 million and, in Forbes\u2019s estimation, the club lost more than $50 million from that season.\n\nUsing a mix of two all-encompassing statistics\u2014Basketball-Reference\u2019s win shares and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s RAPTOR wins above replacement\u2014we calculated the peak and career value for each player drafted (and undrafted) since 1996. (Peak value comprised the top five seasons of a player\u2019s career.) Then, for each class, we ranked the players in three ways: by peak value, by career value, and by an ultimate blend of the two, using baseball\u2019s JAWS model as an example. The first chart shows the top 14 players according to these rankings, while the second looks at the lottery picks that didn\u2019t make the cut. An important caveat is that all of these rankings address regular-season performance only; feel free to mentally adjust placements based on playoff exploits.\n\n","similarity":0.9876510501},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/2019\/10\/21\/20924611\/the-hottest-take-how-harden-can-make-the-finals","id":20688652,"title":"\u2018The Hottest Take\u2019: How Harden Can Make the Finals - The Ringer","description":"Bill Simmons reveals what\u2019s holding James Harden back from playing in the NBA Finals","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/R9vExYxUm6eSbLUA6aETUWloS5I=\/0x0:4928x2580\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19305663\/1176289859.jpg.jpg","tags":"NBA,The Ringer Podcast Network,Sports,The Hottest Take","groups":["The Hottest Take","NBA","The Ringer Podcast Network"],"author":"The Ringer Staff","date":"2019-10-21T08:16:43-04:00","content":"Bill Simmons reveals what\u2019s holding James Harden back from playing in the NBA Finals.","similarity":0.9875401258},{"href":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/nba\/2020\/2\/11\/21134238\/joel-embiid-good-asshole-philadelphia-76ers","id":20898279,"title":"It Took One Game for Joel Embiid to Win Back the Philly Crowd - The Ringer","description":"The \"good asshole\" literally turned jeers into cheers as the Sixers handled the Clippers at home","image":"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/vrltDsoceFf6jsg-xiNlvEXyrec=\/0x291:4052x2412\/fit-in\/1200x630\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19714092\/1200211194.jpg.jpg","tags":"Front Page,NBA,Sports","groups":["NBA","Sports"],"author":"Shaker Samman","date":"2020-02-11T23:51:39-05:00","content":"Since Sunday, all talk surrounding Joel Embiid focused on his desire to become a \u201cgood asshole.\u201d He shushed himself after hitting a dagger 3 against the Bulls on Sunday. He quoted The Dark Knight in a self-reflective Instagram post on Monday. And on Tuesday, in his first game since releasing his new edict, he showed what being a good asshole means.\n\nEmbiid, who opened the night to a mixed chorus of cheers and jeers, wasted no time in flexing on his opponents, and those who dared boo him on his home floor. Just seconds into the 76ers\u2019 showdown with the Clippers, Embiid wrestled a Ben Simmons miss off the rim, and powered straight up, through Kawhi Leonard, for an and-1. And then, as only a good asshole (or the Night King) could do, he raised his arms, and grinned ear to ear.\n\nMade for this...  @NBAonTNT pic.twitter.com\/muoTrHQ2rF\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll get the fans right back on his side,\u201d said TNT\u2019s Stan Van Gundy. \u201cThat\u2019s what they want.\u201d\n\nIt took a little more time, but Philly fans got that and more. In a 110-103 Sixers win, Embiid dropped 26 points, on 8-of-17 shooting, and nine boards in just 28 minutes of action. He added a defensive highlight as well, sending away a Marcus Morris shot that threatened to cut into Philly\u2019s lead late in the fourth quarter, just moments after he and Morris scuffled underneath the Clippers basket.\n\nThis sequence is everything.#PhilaUnite pic.twitter.com\/lpfGYQFkbV\n\nPhiladelphia built on its dominance at home this season, tallying its 25th win at the Wells Fargo Center\u2014which ties Milwaukee for most home victories. In Philly, the Sixers are 25-2; away, they\u2019re just 9-19. They outscore opponents by 10 points per contest at their own gym, compared to a five-point deficit per night on the road. As evidenced on Tuesday, Embiid is a big part of why the Sixers feast on home cooking.\n\nEmbiid works the crowd like a professional wrestler. It doesn\u2019t matter that he might have momentarily turned heel; he has enough charisma to draw fans back in. Some Sixers fans cooled on their franchise center following a four-game losing streak earlier this month, with some pundits taking umbrage with Embiid\u2019s supposed self-shushing. Embiid, the thinking went, was a distraction. He didn\u2019t care about winning, and he didn\u2019t care about the team, and thus, it was right to level him with scorn. But on a night when Ben Simmons was just as electric on both sides of the ball, if not more so, Tuesday\u2019s game added credence to the belief that the Philly faithful appreciate Simmons, but adore Embiid. The big man was booed stepping onto the floor, so he threw it right back, and the interchange was rewarded with hysteria.\n\nHaving Embiid as your franchise centerpiece is a gift. His natural talent, offensive versatility, and seemingly ever-rising ceiling make him an asset for any team. But in the context of the roster built around him in Philadelphia, his play can, at times, leave something to be desired. Embiid was stellar against the Clippers, but for most of the night, he was the second-best Sixer on the floor. The big man might\u2019ve set the tone for Philly with his attitude, but Simmons was its engine. The Aussie tallied a 26-point, 12-rebound, 10-assist triple-double in one of his best performances of the season.\n\nAt times, the Sixers offense looked unstoppable when Embiid sat and Simmons ran the offense. Embiid is hyper-talented on both ends of the floor, but when he plays, the ball moves through him, or around him, or with him in mind. When Simmons plays without him, it just moves. This season, in an almost equal share of minutes per game, Philadelphia scores five more points per 100 possessions with Simmons on the floor sans Embiid than when the two share it. With sole ownership of the spotlight on Tuesday, Simmons delivered. In 17 minutes with Simmons, and without Embiid, Philly outscored the Clippers by an absurd 25.3 points per 100 possessions. When they played together, that mark fell to a still-respectable 7.8. Even more promising, though, was how Embiid and Simmons managed to play off each other to carry the Sixers to a win against one of the league\u2019s toughest outs. Philly still sits fifth in the Eastern Conference, but if it can get combined performances like the ones its two stars delivered on Tuesday, it won\u2019t be long until it climbs up the pecking order.\n\nOne scoop please.  @NBAonTNT | @BenSimmons25 pic.twitter.com\/PiFbieOPHS\n\nTwice, Simmons managed to waltz to the rim after Embiid cleared the way with a bullying pick. In the second quarter, Embiid bulldozed Leonard out of the way, leaving Simmons an open lane to the hoop. In the third, he bodied Ivica Zubac into another zip code.\n\n      pic.twitter.com\/ztjz9k3uEr\n\nThe victims changed, but the result was the same: two points for Philly, and a highlight to go with it. At their best, the Sixers are a force to be reckoned with. But far too often, they\u2019ve been plagued: by Simmons\u2019s lack of shooting range, by Josh Richardson\u2019s and Al Horford\u2019s lackluster shooting and inconsistent play, by Tobias Harris\u2019s aversion to the spotlight, and by Embiid\u2019s injury and drama. If what the Sixers showed against Los Angeles is real, though, and they manage to put it together consistently, there might not be a starting five that can match them.\n\nSince he entered the league, Embiid has consistently doubled down on his antics. He taunted opponents like Andre Drummond, and belittled those who questioned his prowess, all to grandiose results. But as my colleague Haley O\u2019Shaughnessy explored earlier this week, Embiid hadn\u2019t been in the \u201casshole\u201d mind-set that defined the first few years of his career all season. He was critical of himself when challenged by Charles Barkley and Shaquille O\u2019Neal. He was submissive in his comments to the press after Sunday\u2019s win over Chicago. And in September, before the season started, he said he was done talking trash. \n\nIf his performance against the Clippers is any indication, he\u2019s well on his way back to owning real estate in his foes\u2019 heads. He\u2019s a good asshole, now. Cross him at your own peril.","similarity":0.9875383973}]
